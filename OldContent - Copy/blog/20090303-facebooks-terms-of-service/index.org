Like [[https://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10164909--16.html][many other people]], I'm concerned about the recent changes in Facebook's terms of service. Especially, when I read how their [[https://amandafrench.net/2009/02/16/facebook-terms-of-service-compared/][terms of service compare]] This is doubly true now that I've read the [[https://www.newyorker.com/][New Yorker]] article on the subject.

So, being unable to delete my Facebook account, I've:

- turned off as many "applications" as possible
- limited my visibility to others as much as possible
- deactivated my account

Facebook is dead to me, and hopefully, I'm dead to Facebook.
