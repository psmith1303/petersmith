I do quite like [[https://stackful-dev.com/easier-pelican-blogging-with-fabric-automation.html][Pelican]]. It feels pretty clean. The rough edge is the creation of the metadata when creating a new post. [[https://stackful-dev.com/easier-pelican-blogging-with-fabric-automation.html][Stackful.io]] gives a way for doing it using [[https://www.fabfile.org/][Fabric]], but it feels kind of clunky. I need to find a better way to do it. Otherwise, one of my main goals in moving to Pelican---to simplify things so I write more---will be lost.

Talking of automation, I dropped my auto (oh, that's a bad segue) off to [[https://www.nicholsonpanelbeaters.co.nz][Nicholson Panelbeaters]] today. I got rear-ended a few days ago when I stopped at the lights at the motorway on-ramp. Alas, the car (a CRV) behind me didn't notice me until it was a bit late :(

So, my car is in for a few thousand dollars worth of repairs.
