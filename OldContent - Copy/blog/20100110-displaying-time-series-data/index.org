From time-to-time its necessary to display time-series data. I've always tended to use some form of line graph. But there are other ways. In [[https://flowingdata.com/2010/01/07/11-ways-to-visualize-changes-over-time-a-guide/][11 Ways to Visualize Changes Over Time]], Nathan suggests aside from the line, one might use:

- the scatter
- the bar
- the stacked bar
- the area (I think Nathan skipped this one)
- the stacked area
- the bubble
- the colour scale
- the timeline
- the everything
- the animation

And in the comments there are a whole lot more suggested.

I was so interested in Nathan's post, that I read more of his site. It's good. Very good. So much so that I've subscribed to [[https://feeds.feedburner.com/FlowingData][his RSS feed]].
