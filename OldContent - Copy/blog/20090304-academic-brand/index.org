Does one need an academic brand that is independent from ones current institution? [[https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2009/academic-branding-and-portfolio-control/][Some say yes.]] and it certainly shouldn't be like Facebook or LinkedIn.

Alas, I've yet to find a really good vehicle for maintaining my teaching portfolio, research portfolio,/etc/.
