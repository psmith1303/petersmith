In an earlier [[{{< relref "20040525-still-doing-maps-and-incidents" >}}][entry]] I wrote (complete with typo--/out/ should be /our/):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Maps filter out perceptions of the real world. They bring some things into sharp relief and diminish the importance of other things.

#+END_QUOTE

find:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE
