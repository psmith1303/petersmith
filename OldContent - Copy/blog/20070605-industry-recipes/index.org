I was tracking down some information on methodology (in particular the work of [[https://www.jcspender.com/][J-C Spender]] when I came across his web site.

It put me on to a good Org. Theory site, called (unsurprisingly) [[https://orgtheory.wordpress.com/][OrgTheory]]

Anyway, going back to John-Christopher, one of his best works is:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Spender, J.-C. (1989). /Industry recipes: An enquiry into the nature and sources of managerial judgement/. Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell.

#+END_QUOTE

This book is no longer in print, but JC is distributing from his web site. It's an absolute classic, so if you don't have a copy [[https://www.jcspender.com/uploads/Industry_recipes.pdf][download one]]. What I didn't know is that the book was based on his PhD thesis; that must of been one outstanding thesis.
