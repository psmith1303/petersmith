I have now completed [[{{ relfref "20220103-new-theme-progres" }}][step 2]] in building the new theme for this site; The IndieWeb tags to support the h-entry, and h-card entities are working again, as is the bits to get [[https://indieweb.org/rel-me][rel="me"]] going.

At the same time, I have made the 'mobile' version of the site, a little less clunky.  So, far so very good.
