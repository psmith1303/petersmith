Tonight we went along to see [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6760956/][Pecking Order]], courtesy of [[https://www.flicks.co.nz/][Flicks]]. What a delightful film about the world of competitive chicken (and other birds) raising.

The documentary team did a great job of showing the passion and expertise of those involved in this somewhat niche hobby. Perhaps calling it a hobby does it a disservice; there were plenty of folk for who it is much more serious than that.

Definitely a film to see.
