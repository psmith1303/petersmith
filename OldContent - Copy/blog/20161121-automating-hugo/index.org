I'm starting to live in Emacs, and so I wanted to automate---a bit---the way in which I create posts.

So, I took a bit of code from https://wmanger.com/ and mixed in a lot of code from [[https://blog.tohojo.dk/2015/10/integrating-hugo-into-emacs.html][Toke Høiland-Jørgensen]]. The result is something that, creates a file and opens it with the minimal [[https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/][Hugo frontmatter]]. For this post the front matter looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE toml

#+title: Automating Hugo

#+END_EXAMPLE

So far, so good. But I want to have something a little more 'complete'.

I could use some clever stuff like snippets to do, but instead I just tweaked the file =archetypes/blog.md= to look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE toml

categories = [ "Jottings", "Blogging", "The Arts", "Out and about", "Running", "Fitness", "Learning", "Teaching", "Case teaching", "Plagiarism", "Research", "Writing", "Data analysis", "Productivity", "IT", "Technology" ]
#+draft: False

#+END_EXAMPLE

This will magically get merged with the date and title.
