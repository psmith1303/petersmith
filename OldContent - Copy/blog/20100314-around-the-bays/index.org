[[https://www.roundthebays.co.nz/][Around the bays]] is an Auckland tradition. So, I had a go this year. My time for the 8.4km was 45 minutes 47 seconds or about 10.5 km/hr. Lisa assumes that I'll do it next year---she is probably right. Now I have a target to beat.

[[https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com][Andrew]] did it in about 41 minutes (having run the distance from the finish to the start). Outstanding!
