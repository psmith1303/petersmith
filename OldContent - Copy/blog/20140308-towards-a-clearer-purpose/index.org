I think that one of the reasons that this journal has stagnated is that I have not been clear in my own mind as to its purpose. Although, I thought was was clear when I [[{{< relref "20091203-the_first_entry" >}}][first started]], in practice I was too vague.

So, this is a space where I can reflect on my teaching. I say that with a little hesitation, as the work /teaching/ comes with connotations of it being something I do with or to others; whereas I seen the teaching/learning 'thing' as being a joint activity (I was going to say endeavour, but that too is rather loaded).

So, I'm going to spend a little time moving my teaching related posts from the other locations, into this journal.
