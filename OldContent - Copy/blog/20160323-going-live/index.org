So, I have kinda of gone live with using Hugo for my journal/blog/portfolio etc.

All the content isn't in place yet. I still need to sort out:

- My teaching history (courses)
- My teaching portfolio (2008) and the indexes to my portfolios.
- My publications
- The resources section

It will take a while to do in my spare time, but I will get there.

Well it's taken longer than I expected, but most of these are done now.
