This was the last film that we went to see at the [[https://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz/][film festival]]. Maybe I don't /get/ French comedy, but I found the end of this film incompressible. It started off with a good premise, and some interesting ideas, but overall it is a stinker.I'll give it one star out of-five.
