Having downloaded my emails from [[https://gmail.com/][Gmail]] (so I can have a backup), how do I read them (in case Gmail goes down).

We'll I've elected to use [[https://www.mutt.org/][mutt]], which is a
nice piece of software based on the "Worse is better" principle. As the
author of mutt says:

Most of the configuration for mutt can be done through the .muttrc file.
Mine is like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

set mbox_type=Maildir
set folder="\~/Gmail-archive"
set spoolfile="\~/Gmail-archive"
set mbox="\~/Gmail-archive"
set mask="!^.[^.]"
set record="+.Sent"
set postponed="+.Drafts"
set reply_regexp="\^(((___SPAM___[t])|[rR][eE]:[ t])\_)+"
set pager_index_lines=9
color index brightgreen default \~p \#To me (personal)
color index yellow default \~N \#New
color index yellow default \~O \#Old
bind pager <up> previous-line
bind pager <down> next-line
bind pager <left> exit
bind pager <right> view-attachments
bind attach <left> exit
bind attach <right> view-attach
bind index <right> display-message
macro index <left> "c?"
bind browser <right> select-entry
bind browser <left> exit

#+END_EXAMPLE

The little regex bit remove the */SPAM/* heading from messages (that is attached by our mail system to suspect Spam) if I decide to reply to it. I.e., if a mail item is incorrectly classified I don't want the send to be bothered by the fact it was labelled as-Spam.
