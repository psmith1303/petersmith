Last year I had a little play with [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] the bibliographic add-on for Firefox.. Whilst it worked pretty well, the integration with Word was a little flakey, so I didn't adopt the programme.

I've been trying it out again, and I'm really impressed. I exported all my references from [[https://www.endnote.com][EndNote]] and gave it a pretty solid workout. It's good. It's very good.
