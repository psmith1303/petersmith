Sometime ago, [[https://jeremy.zawodny.com/][Jeremy Zawodny]] published a piece entitled [[https://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/008758.html][Desktop Tower Defense Considered Harmful]] Well he is right.

[[https://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/][Desk Tower Defence]] is a very addictive flash based game. I've finally given up. I never cracked 8000 points, but I did get over 7000. Playing the /challenge/ games, I got hooked on the /one hundred/, but I've never gotten past level 77. Anyway, as the voice at the end of each game says, "Right, I better do some work-then"
