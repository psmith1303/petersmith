/Episteme/, for the Greeks, "meant something not quite identical to our 'knowledge' .... episteme could mean both knowledge and skill, know that and knowing how." (p. 31). In this way it is close to the work /techne/ that did mean 'skill'. In the verbal form, /epistamai/ it means "knowing how to do something" (p. 31).

"/Episteme/ did not exclude practical skill. However, not any human ability, not any manual dexterity could be called /episteme/. Many of them were referred to by the much less honorific title of /empeirira/" (p. 35).
