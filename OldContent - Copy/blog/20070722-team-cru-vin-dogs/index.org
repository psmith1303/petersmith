I've spent a happy few hours this weekend putting together a website for [[https://www.teamcruvindogs.com/][Team Cru Vin Dogs]]. It's been a nice distraction from writing (my PhD thesis).

The design work was done by Grant Hunter at [[https://www.huntercreative.co.nz/][Hunter Creative]], and I assembled the plumbing using:

- [[https://www.drupal.org][Drupal]] as the CMS
- [[https://www.a2hosting.com][A2]] as the hosting company
- [[https://www.networksolutions.com/][Network Solutions]] for the domain name

It will be interesting to see how much financial support for [[https://www.mobilitydogs.co.nz][Mobility Dogs]] will be generated; after all that is the main purpose of the [[https://www.teamcruvindogs.com/][Team Cru Vin Dogs]] site.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without the support of [[https://www.cruvindogs.com][Cru Vin Dogs]] who are funding the racing team.
