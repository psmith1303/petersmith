Peter Smith has been a colleague for the last five years. Peter has
taken a pedagogical lead in many activities, discussions and
initiatives in our department and others and that has meant he has
made a real impact in the teaching and learning of this department.
He has a passion for effective, student-centred, stimulating
learning and that zeal has galvanised many of us to work at our own
teaching development.

Peter continually seeks new ideas to enthuse, extend and galvanise
students. He is truly innovative, creative and original in his
planning of learning experiences. He engineers role-plays,
develops simulations and games, and seeks out new business cases in
order to produce fresh challenges for his students. Peter is the true
reflective educational practitioner to the extent he thinks about
and evaluates each learning occasion.

Perhaps the biggest impact Peter has had on his colleagues lies in his
willingness to embrace and foster new technologies, curriculum and
assessment tools. Time after time Peter has volunteered to be in teams
to rewrite and create new programmes and instruments of learning. He
has taken a lead in trailing new plagiarism instruments such as
Turnitin, writing new student assessment descriptors and working out
new ways of involving interactive technologies. He is always
generous in supporting others in their uptake of new teaching
techniques and has taken a real leadership role in this.

Peter is an energetic, knowledgeable and greatly skilled teaching
colleague who continually inspires us to improve our own teaching
performance. I can not think of a worthier candidate for such
an award.
