Below are my comments in regards to your teaching of the MBA Research
Project:

The overall quality of the teaching was very good. This is examined
against my personal criteria defined below (along with comments):

-   The level and quality of guidance/support provided
    -   This was excellent. The teaching felt personalised and
        questions asked were answered to ensure every student was
        moving forward. Each session was well structured with
        advanced notice and follow up information. In contrast, many
        other papers were quite generalised and anything outside of
        the teaching curriculum was ignored.

-   How approachable the teacher is
    -   The teacher was very approachable and had a true open door
        policy where students were always welcome. I always felt
        comfortable to ask any questions and could communicate by
        phone/email or direct. It was certainly shown that Peter wanted
        the students to succeed, unlike some teachers who just wanted
        to get the teaching done.

-   How well the teaching is tailored for the audience
    -   I found the teaching level appropriate. Peter was quite
        dynamic in his ability to get a feel of where the class was at
        and to ensure that we were getting the right information. In
        many other situations (other papers) the teaching level was
        too basic however the teacher never adjusted the level and just
        stuck with what they had planned.

-   How challenging and interesting are the topics presented/taught
    -   I felt that the class outline was designed well. It was
        structured to guide the students and provided them the
        necessary knowledge and tools at the right times.

-   Quality and usefulness of material and presentation media
    -   Good combination of slides/articles/whiteboard was used.
        Generally most classes throughout postgrad and MBA provided
        good course material.

-   The overall value/impact the teaching created for me personally
    -   Peter was very motivating and supportive. I was encouraged
        to do well and he showed great interest in my progress and what
        I was actually doing. I saw this as an additional level of
        feedback which enabled my research project to free flow and
        advance. I feel that this was certainly not provided with
        other papers and that the majority of the feedback was from
        assignment/exam grades. Overall, I felt that the teaching
        provided me with the tools to professionally perform
        research and the confidence to present a professional
        research report.
