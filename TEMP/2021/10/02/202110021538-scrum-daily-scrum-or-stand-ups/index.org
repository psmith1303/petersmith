The time when the Scrum Team synchronizes and prioritizes activities for the day.

In 15 minutes, each team member answers the question:
- What did I do yesterday to help the team meet the Sprint Goal
- What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal
- What impediments do I see to the team meeting the Sprint Goal

This helps the Scrum Master unblock the team.
