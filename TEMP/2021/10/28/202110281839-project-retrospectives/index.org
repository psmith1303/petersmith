A workshop or meeting that gives project teams time to reflect on a project.

Often done after major milestones, or at the end of project.

** The main purposes of retrospectives
1. Encourage team building
2. Facilitate improved collaboration
3. Promote positive changes

The emphasis in retrospectives is on continuous improvement and change instead of recycling old and potentially bad habits, procedures, and processes.

** Reasons to hold a retrospective
- Missed deadlines or expectations
- Miscommunication between stakeholders
- Reach the end of a sprint
- Project launches and landings
- Record key lessons that other people can learn from

The way you choose to structure a retrospective will depend on your team and workplace.

** Best practices
- Ensure the discussion is blameless
  Achieved by:
  - Changing perspectives, and
  - Switching from "you" language to "we" language
- Reflect on positive aspects of the project as well as the negatives
