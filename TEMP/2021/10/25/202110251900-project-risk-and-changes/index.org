Change is anything that alters or impacts the tasks, structures, or processes with a project.

Sometimes, change can have a positive effect --- but that is rare.

Types of changes:
- New or changing dependencies
- Changing priorities
- Capacity and people
- Limitations on budgets or resources
- Scope creep
- Force majeure

Changes should be measured against the baseline estimates of scope, budget, and time allotted for your project, given the original requirements.

Organisationally, changes may require a *change request form*
