The three pillars of Scum are transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

** Transparency
Make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome.
- That means everyone (team, stakeholders, project manager, etc)
- It's easier with a small team

** Inspection
Conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.
- The more inspections that take place, the more improvement a team experiences in their work.

** Adaptation
Adjusting project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation of issues.

Although adaptation includes immediate fixes to problems, it may also be about implementing a change, so future projects don't repeat past mistakes.
