The triple constraint model is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project: scope, time, and cost.

We've talked a bit about what scope is, so let's focus now on time and cost.

- Time refers to the project schedule and deadlines.
- Cost includes the budget, and it also covers resources and the people who will work on the project.

Both time and budget have to be carefully managed alongside scope. All three of these are linked; you can't change one without having an impact on the others.

This reminds me of the other triple constraint: quality, speed, price. Here quality is a proxy for scope.
