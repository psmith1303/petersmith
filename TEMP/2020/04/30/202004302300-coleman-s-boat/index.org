Coleman (1987, 1990) provided a scheme that has become something of a standard way of representing macro-micro links.

A --> D (4) represents the macro conditions and the /empirical regularity/ of the macro outcomes or macro regularities.

A --> B (1) represents /empirical regularity/ of the represents the micro conditions that arise from A. These macro to micro relations are various called action formation mechanisms (Coleman, xx) or bridge assumptions (Lindenberg 1981; Wippler and Lindenberg, 1987).

B --> C (2) represents the /regularity/ of the micro outcomes, that is, individual behaviour arising from the micro conditions. Arrow 2 provides a micro theory.

C --> D (3) represents how actors' behaviour generations macro outcomes. These are variously called transformational mechanisms (Coleman, 1987) or transformation rules (Lindenberg 1981; Wippler and Lindenberg, 1987).

The macro and micro in this model can apply to large (e.g., a city) or small social systems (e.g., families).

The arrows in the model represent assumptions about the empirical regularities, rather than general causal laws.

"The situational mechanisms describe how social structures constrain individuals’ action and cultural environments shape their desires and beliefs, the action-formation mechanisms describe how individuals choose their preferred courses of action among the feasible alternatives, and the transformational mechanisms describe how individual actions produce various intended and unintended social outcomes."
