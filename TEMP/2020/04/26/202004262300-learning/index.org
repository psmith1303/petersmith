Terry Doyle definition:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Learning is the ability to use information after a significant period of disuse

#+END_QUOTE

and

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

It is the ability to use the information to solve problems in a context different (if only slightly) from the context in which the information was originally taught learnt.

#+END_QUOTE

The change to the final sentence is mine rather than Terry's.
