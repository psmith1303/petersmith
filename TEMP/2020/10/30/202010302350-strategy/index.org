The idea of strategy seems to be fundamental to modern approaches to business. But, there is no simple definition of the concept of strategy

* Definitions of strategy

- "Strategy is about winning"
- "A strategy is the way in which an organisation achieves its goals"
- "A strategy is the pattern of resource deployments it undertakes in order to achieve its objectives"

- How firms achieve above average performance (i.e. how they create value uniquely):
  - Industry positioning
  - Mobilization of tangible and intangible resources to create value
  - Activities that create value and consume/create resources

- “Profit is for wimps” (Economist, 23Sep 2000 p. 21)

According to \autocite{quinn_strategies_1980}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

A strategy is the /pattern/ or /plan/ that integrates an organisations /major goals/, policies and action sequences into a /cohesive whole/.

A well formulated strategy helps to /marshal/ and /allocate/ an organisation’s resources into a unique and viable posture based on its relative internal competencies and shortcomings, anticipated changes in the environment, and contingent on moves by intelligent opponents.

#+END_QUOTE

On the other hand, Mintzberg describes strategy as being "a pattern in the stream of actions"

- Pattern	=	regularity and consistency
- Stream	=	revealed in and over time
- Action	=	activity, praxis
