According to [[https://rtalbert.org/unreasonable-effectiveness-flipped-learning/][Robert Talbert]]:

According to the definition of flipped learning in my book,

Flipped Learning is a pedagogical approach in which first contact with new concepts moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space in the form of structured activity, and the resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the educator guides students as they apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter.

He then goes on to say that focus of flipped learning is a more "intentional use of the time that instructors and students have together.... It's about making the most of the time we have, when we are present with students".
