Auckland, 29 October 2004

Peter Smith and I have been working together for more than 5 years. We
have designed and taught-MGMT302 Business Policy and Strategy course.
The course is very demanding for students and for us teachers, as it
involves intensive case classroom discussions and thorough weekly
preparations for class. Peter invests enormous amount of energy and
all his theoretical and practical knowledge in preparing the
course: designing assignments, finding new and interesting cases
and readings, and developing new ways of class discussion. It was
Peter's idea to develop a test bank (more than 600 questions) to
accompany the course textbook. The test bank was accepted by editors
of the textbook (de Wit and Meyer, 2000) and published at the Thomson
Learning website as a supplementary material with the following
comment "the best multiple-choice questions ever seen".

Peter is a great facilitator in the class environment. He leads case
discussions superbly; paying attention to every detail, leading
students through all important aspects of the case, allowing
students to be creative and to broaden their perspectives, and
giving everybody an equal chance to participate. Peter's
communication with students, either in the form of individual
consultation or classroom interaction, shows the occurrence of
intellectual exchange of ideas and, at the same time, support and
encouragement. Peter selflessly gives his time to students and
provides them with all of his available support. In his unique way, he
motivates students to learn more and do it efficiently so they can
achieve what they thought would be impossible at the beginning of the
course.

Needless to say, Peter is of great help in administering the course.
As a colleague and co-teacher, I have to emphasise that Peter is the
most skilful person in course administrative matters at
the-MER-department.

It is my enormous pleasure to work and teach with Peter Smith. I
warmly support Peter's nomination for the School Teaching Award and
wish him all the best in his future teaching and research endeavours.
