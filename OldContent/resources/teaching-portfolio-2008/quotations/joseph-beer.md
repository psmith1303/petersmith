MGMT-101 Course Co-Ordinator  
Department of Management and Employment Relations.  
University of Auckland.

It is with great pleasure that I provide these words of support for
Peter Smith in his application for a teaching excellence award. I
have been a colleague of Peter's over the past three years and have
work closely with him in the preparation and delivery of MGMT 101
over the past year. Peter is a trusted and respected colleague. He is
consistently the first person to offer assistance with the
preparation of the course and advice on assessment and content
related matters. Peter is strongly commitment to teaching
excellence and places an extraordinary amount of effort into
searching out new methods of teaching delivery to assist with
student learning. This commitment has enabled him to create vibrant
and enjoyable learning environments for his students, and has
lifted the bar of expectation for his colleagues regarding their
commitment to teaching and learning. Peter's positive nature and
his desire to do what is best for his students and his colleagues
makes all interactions with him, and especially having him part of
the MGMT 101 teaching team, enjoyable and rewarding. I believe that a
teaching excellence award for Peter would be a welcomed decision by
all of his colleagues and students and would send a strong message of
support for the level of teaching commitment that teachers like
Peter Smith show throughout the University.
