I do not think many people experience being 'taught' at university.
It was an unusual feeling when I started Peter's paper the
repetitious cycle of attending classes, being lectured, taking
notes and studying was removed, and instead I was subconsciously
immersed in learning. To me Peter is a pioneer, his approach to course
design provided the chance to learn without penalty and have the
opportunity to make mistakes something that is not offered in many
classes. I was challenged to _stop sitting on the fence_ and have the
confidence to present my perspective on an idea to both my teacher
and my fellow peers. This concept was challenging at first but the
open atmosphere of the class where questions were expected and the
constant feedback from Peter saw me gain a tremendous amount of self
confidence. He does not fit the traditional lecturer's mould; Peter
is a teacher who had an amazing amount of passion for our class and is
not afraid to show it. This was unsurprisingly reciprocated by the
passion that we developed for our paper. I use the word 'our' because
as students we developed a relationship of shared respect with Peter
that often saw us break the traditional student lecturer hierarchy
and challenge our teacher's ideas. We became impassioned towards the
paper as Peter led us down paths of discovery outside of the
boundaries of our course. If it was not for Peter enthusiasm towards
teaching I can honestly say I would not be in the position I am
today. He has fostered a hidden ability in me for management and
strategy and inadvertently driven my aspirations toward a career
that utilises all of the knowledge gained while taking his paper. I
now compete in strategy competitions (a suggestion from Peter)
with the support of my teacher, his door is never shut and he is always
willing to provide any guidance that will help me.
