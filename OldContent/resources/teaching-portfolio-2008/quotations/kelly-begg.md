... I just want to say thanks for taking MGMT 301 this semester, and
congratulations on your new role [as Deputy Director of the
Auckland-MBA]. I think that the paper will definitely be less without
your skills (and stirring spoon!), but that MGMT 301's loss is
the MBAs gain... something for when I finally manage to get back to
university!

Anyway, thanks again for helping make this paper the most enjoyable
one I've done in my degree
