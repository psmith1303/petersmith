I do enjoy podcasts. One of the best ones I've found is done by the folks at [[https://www.manager-tools.com/][Manager Tools]]. Their podcasts provide a wide range of behaviours that managers can implement to improve their effectiveness (and efficiency).

If you want to be a better manager---and you want to improve in bite size pieces, then /Manager Tools/ could be the site for-you.
