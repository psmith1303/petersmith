For many years I've run my own host for this website. Well no more. I'm now using those nice people at [[https://www.a2hosting.com/][A2 Hosting]]. I was put on to them by Merlin at [[https://43folders.com/][43Folders]].

So, far so good. They've been very responsive (every time I wanted a new Perl module added, etc). The only problem I am having at the moment is getting [[https://www.djangoproject.com/][Django]] working (as they don't support mod_python).

Consequently, I've abandoned my implementation of [[https://www.davidco.com/][GTD]] and started to use [[https://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/][Tracks]] which is a [[https://www.rubyonrails.org/][Ruby on Rails]] implementation. I don't know Ruby (and I don't really have time to learn it), but [[https://www.rubyonrails.org/][Rails]] is well supported by [[https://www.a2hosting.co.nz/][A2 Hosting]].
