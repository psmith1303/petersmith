So, I say, "I /like/ feedback, and yet I have /comments/ disabled".

Hmm. I have a lot of good /reasons/ not to enable comments, but what is really going on. Oh it sounds a bit like that I want to:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

1. be in unilateral control; (b) strive to win and not lose;
2. suppress negative feelings; and (d) act rationally (Argyris, 2002, p.Â 212).

#+END_QUOTE

So, from now, comments are now on[fn:1].
