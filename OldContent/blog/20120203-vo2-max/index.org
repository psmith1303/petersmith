If you're serious about training for a sport, it can be really helpful to know you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max][VO2 max]] and your [[https://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/lactate-threshold.html][lactate threshold]].

So, I'm off the University of Auckland's [[https://www.clinics.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/our-services/health-and-performance/]["Health and Performance Clinic"]]. They are doing a special (until 1 March 2012), whereby you can get either test done for just $50 (the price of the consumables).

But it gets better, if I can get 20 people to do it, then the cost will only be $45 for each test. How good is that.

When you book (on 09 923 2541) just mention mention [[https://www.dailymile.com/people/PeterSmith]["Daily Mile"]] or [[https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/]["Andrew is Getting fit"]].
