I have a large number of documents that I need to "re-style' before I import them into [[https://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx][nVivo]]. I can import the necessary style into each document one-by-one, but I've been looking for a way to apply styles across multiple files (either all at once, or automatically/programmatically).

As I trawled the web looking for a solution, I can across this amusing [[https://www.goodiebag.tv/episodes/06_trajan_is_the_movie_font.htm][rant]] against the font [[https://www.linotype.com/8565/trajanregular-font.html][Trajan]]. Indeed, there is an entire website devoted to [[https://www.retiretrajan.com/][retiring Trajan]]
