It's been awhile since I've had a fitness assessment. The last times were in 2002 and 2004. So, here we are, about 10 years on from the first one. Let's compare today's results with history.

Of course, this is all age dependent.

So, my body fat is 17%. This is in the good range, but I'd like to loose another 10Kg. The trainer (Aimee) reckons that with the weight (muscle) I'll put on from training, I should only get a 5Kg reduction, and that---in combination---will take my fat down to about 10% (and apparently, we don't want to go much lower than that).

So, some interesting changes and improvements. Clearly running has had a good impact, but I've been neglecting some parts of my body.

I wonder what I might do about my shoulders.
