Over on [[https://calnewport.com/][Study Hacks]] there is an article on [[https://calnewport.com/blog/?p=121][How to Build a Paper Research Database]]. The article describes:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

This is how you win a Pulitzer Prize. Imagine, then, what this technique would do for an undergraduate research paper or your senior honors thesis. In this article, I'm going to teach you how to build a simplified Branch-style Paper Research Database using Microsoft Excel. I'll tell you how to format it, populate it, and use it to structure your writing.

#+END_QUOTE

It seems to me that just by using [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] would do much (if not all) of what the article recommends. Not only that, Zotero would do it more easily and quickly.
