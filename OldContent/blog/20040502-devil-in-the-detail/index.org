I was looking at some Bike industries just trying to figure out what was going on with the retail margins that are being used. And this is what I came up with (I've mangled the numbers a little-- but the proportions are right):

| Where           | Total   | FirmA   | FirmB   | FirmC   | FirmD   | FirmE   |
|-----------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| Bike stores     | 340     | -90     | -42     | -52     | -90     | -90     |
| Dept. stores    | 540     | 190     | 105     | 125     | 120     | 0       |
| Sports stores   | 660     | 220     | 135     | 135     | 165     | 0       |

So what does it all mean? Well, not a lot if you don't know the retail margin or the amount of extra support being given. But I'd suspect that one firm has an explicit strategy in this area.
