It lives (again)!

[[{{< relref "20060728-bad-dog" >}}][Bad]] [[{{< relref "20070223-bad-dog-2" >}}][Dog]] is [[https://baddog.ac.nz][back up and running]].

At this stage, I have set it up to allow students to maintain blogs (as a form of learning journals) and later I hope to get a wiki working again.

Bad Dog was taken down a few years ago, but since then there have been a number of requests to liven it up again. Now that I'm teaching again on /MGMT 300--Management in dynamic contexts/ (MGMT 300 is the replacement course for MGMT 301, which was the course that was grounded in using the Mike's Bike simulation as a /field of practice/) I have had the time (and the imperative) to get it going again.
