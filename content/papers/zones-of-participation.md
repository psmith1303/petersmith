This paper shows how strategic initiatives in the context of well-established
open strategy processes at two producer co-operatives reveal
four tensions related to inclusion and transparency at the level of both the
firm and the individual actor. We derive a “zones of participation” model
that shows how tensions created by the interplay of the content, process
and context of strategy cause actors to participate (or not participate) in
open strategy formulation and implementation. We address theoretical and
practical implications regarding the open strategy content, process, and
context interplay, including a range of management tactics required in
different participation zones.
