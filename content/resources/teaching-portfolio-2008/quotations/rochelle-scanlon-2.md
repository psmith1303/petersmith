I have worked alongside Peter as a tutor this semester. His
innovativeness surprises me; Peter constantly looks for ways to
improve his teaching, and his course, not just for the benefit of
students next semester but for his current students. This is
facilitated by his openness towards feedback from his students and
me about the course and his teaching style. The immediate approach he
takes of honest self reflection and correction was refreshing. This
semester has seen Peter through investigation and readings
establish alternative participation avenues to cater for
different learning styles, which was very much appreciated by many
students whom had been struggling under the previous methods.
Peter?s passion for teaching the best way possible has led to the
creation of a constantly evolving teaching environment that is a
brimming with engaged students who enjoy not only being taught by
Peter but engaging with Peter after class. Many have freely expressed
on completion of the final class that their knowledge, ability and
confidence has 'grown'. It was a pleasure to work with someone who
not only teaches students but takes a holistic interest in their
wellbeing and inspires them to do the best that they can.
