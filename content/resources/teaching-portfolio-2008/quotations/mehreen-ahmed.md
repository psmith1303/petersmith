Peter Smith's class Business Policy and Strategy (2002 Semester I)
taught me a lot about myself and my ability to think strategically.

As a lecturer Peter has a genuine love of teaching his students new
things. His approach towards them is a challenging and a forthright
one, where he tries to evoke lateral thinking, rather than just
text-book thinking. Coupled with a passion for the topic and a
friendly outlook, Peter was able to motivate and encourage students
to get more out of their learning.

My personal involvement with Peter has allowed me to grow as a
person. I was very unsure of myself and my ideas during the first
couple of weeks in his class. Peter seemed to be aware of this, and
would often challenge me to speak up in class. His constant belief in
my ability, his questioning and his encouragement allowed me to
open up. In turn, I began to reflect his attitude towards his paper.

The way he taught the paper made me feel passionate. I was pleasantly
surprised at the lack of an authoritative, spoon-feeding and
patronizing approach in Peter. Instead, he laid the onus of learning
key issues on students. The trust and respect he instilled in
students, to be responsible over their learning, was reflected in
our heated discussions of the theory. To make sure we understood the
theory, Peter encouraged a case-study discussion per class, where we
related practice to theory. During these discussions, Peter forced
us to think outside of the square and question our learning, which
helped expand our ability to critique the world around us. Something,
I believe is valuable in my current work and academic experience.
Peter's innovative style of teaching and passion for his topic has
always received positive verbal feedback. Much of the class of 2002
felt honoured to be in his class and felt as if they had learned
life-relevant issues from it.

Peter has always remained a positive influence on my life. I am
currently completing my MCom thesis. I owe my place in the program
to Peter's influence and nurturance of my academic abilities. He
continues to teach me a lot about life in our daily interactions and
he always encourages me to think that I can be the best.

Peter deserves this teaching award not only for his ability to
innovatively teach and inspire learning in his students, but also
because of his consistently friendly and concerned approach towards
his students.
