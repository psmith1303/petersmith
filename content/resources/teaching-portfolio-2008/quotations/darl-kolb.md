It is with pleasure that I offer this endorsement for a Teaching
Excellence Award for my colleague, Peter Smith. I have had the honour
of collaborating with Peter Smith for the past six (6) years on a
course entitled, _Management Theory and Practice_(MGMT 301). "301"
is a full-semester intensively experiential, web-based
multi-disciplinary business simulation, where student
"management teams"compete with one another and peers from other
institutions (e.g.,EIT in the Hawkes Bay, Canadian teams, etc.) in a
virtual global bicycle industry. The course has been wildly
successful and a great deal of the credit goes to Peter's
unparalleled enthusiasm for innovation and continuous
improvement in pedagogy, course design and teaching delivery.

First, pedagogically, as someone who holds a Masters degree in the
Social Foundations of Education, with a specialisation in
experiential education, I am continually amazed at Peter's deep
and profound understanding of how humans learn. Much of the
philosophical underpinnings of advanced study seem to just come to
Peter. His world view seems naturally moulded around how to take an
idea or concept and make it _real_ and meaningful for students. This
intuitive wisdom is matched by his persistence in keeping up with
the literature on simulations in education, organisational
behaviour teaching methods and other related management education
topics. Beyond learning in the classroom, his overarching goal is
for our students to become what Argyris and Sch&ouml;n (1974) have called
"reflective practitioners".

Second, course design is a real speciality of Peter's. Again, I
consider myself a fairly innovative teacher, but I'm no match for
Peter's ability to think of incredibly interesting and effective
ways to approach age-old problems of teaching. For example, while
our 301 course was no doubt interesting and different for the
students, it was also very time-consuming in the early days. This was
fine for a year or so, but ultimately we had to find ways to be not
only effective, but also efficient at what we were doing. And, that is
precisely where Peter's imagination really kicks in. Subsequently,
we have kept the best parts of the course and totally revamped aspects
that were not working as well as they could for us and the students.
The result is that the course remains as engaging and challenging as
ever for students, but also is manageable and sustainable for us as
Lecturers, something that is essential in a research-led
institution.

Third, in the area of teaching delivery, Peter is a master in front
of the class and "behind the scenes". I love watching him work a room,
with his well-organised and deftly crafted slides. But, it is with
systems such as Turnitin and course management software that he also
shines like no else I've ever worked with. Besides leading a
Departmental initiative to actively confront the issue of
plagiarism, he is a keen user and tutor for the rest of us when it
comes to CECIL, nDeva and other courseware tools. He gets our students
blogging, which most of us are just too lazy to do. Moreover, when we
decided to start doing research with our undergraduate students,
Peter wrote a software application to put problem-solving
exercises into a virtual environment. Mind blowing! You get this
sort of person at MIT, but not generally around the U of A!

In summary, my teaching in the past 6 years has been made so much more
rewarding and enjoyable because I have had the privilege of working
with Peter Smith. It has been so much fun for me and I'm sure that our
students will attest to the quality of instruction they have received
from Peter. He is a rare and inspiring teacher, who deserves to be
rewarded as much as possible. I heartily support this award for such
an outstanding innovative and hard-working teacher.
