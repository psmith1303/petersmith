The research course for The Auckland MBA took 6 months to complete.
During that time Peter was teaching the class, leading us through the
research course. Peter was also involved in other aspects of The
Auckland-MBA-throughout the year. I recall a discussion with Peter
during a break from a lecture early in quarter two, we were
discussing over coffee how I could feel the MBA programme was
loading us up with more work than I thought could be completed in the
time available. We discussed how as a class we were learning more
than just the course content we were also learning how to achieve more
through team work and collaboration, essential skills as you put
the MBA to real work in the business world. That involvement from
Peter and his help in making sense of the entire years content for the
Auckland MBA was different to the type of help I received during the
Diploma classes. The teaching style during the Diploma was much more
about the specific course content, the linkages between the courses
were not strong and as a student I had to make my own pathway through
the Diploma to then apply for The Auckland MBA.

The content of the research course that Peter lead had everything that
it needed. Peter was very good at managing the pace and time, which
quickly ran out. Peter was consistent and reliable which became very
important when appointments needed to be met. Peter outlined the
requirements of the research and set for me the direction and then set
the expectation that I would go and do the work and that we would be
meeting again soon to discuss progress. Peter had made his
expectations clear and was frank in telling me when he thought I could
do better.

There was much more to completing the research than just the content
of the lectures and following along the text book, Peter also needed
to manage us as a class that during the same six months completed two
other courses and managed complex personal lives and most students
like myself were still working full time. Peter recognised that we
were people too and made himself available to talk to us. Another
example of Peter's leadership style I recall is the first class after
we returned from International Business, where three or four
students turned up. I said I was there because I needed to re-engage
into the research and even though I had carried the books to Argentina
and back I had not opened them for the past three weeks. My two or three
other classmates were feeling the same, so Peter let us share stories
and photographs from the trip and we finished early. I then went to
Library until 9:00 pm feeling engaged, motivated and ready to carry on
and finish the research.

The impact of Peter's teaching and leadership during the year and
specifically the research project, has been for me to recognise the
value in a strong peer group for discussion and the power in having
specific goals and expectations set which are reviewed as well as the
important aspects of the emotional requirements when managing
people to perform while they are under pressure.
