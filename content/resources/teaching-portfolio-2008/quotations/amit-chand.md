I read that you were no longer teaching MGMT 301 which will be a great
loss to future students. The two best papers that I have taken
practical lessons away from were 301 and 302, I think it is no
coincidence that you were lecturing both of those. Your upfront and
to the point style of teaching although a little bit challenging to
someone coming across it for the first time, kind of grows on-you.

Another point of difference is that probably have the least amount
of notes from those papers, especially with 301 the book is something
I will keep going back to. Unlike other papers where we get a wad of
notes and a shiny text book neither of which had the depth of
material to go back to.
