I would rank the quality and impact of your teaching as very high from
a personal perspective.

Positives:

1.  Willing to understand students individual experience and
    translate academic value to that environment
2.  Ability to understand various industry to translate where
    academic input can be of-value
3.  Timely in response to queries
4.  Able to commit time and individual attention, recognising the
    pressures of the work/study balance
5.  Vastly experienced in the areas of academic research and able
    to direct a students thinking on particular topics to current
    material, or able to understand that material in a logical
    manner and able to direct attention in order to explain the value
    of the academic research process
6.  Friendly and respectful.
7.  Firm and able to motivate the delivery of results

I would have limited negative points, particularly considering
the challenges you faced last year, and I think its unfair to conclude
on your group teaching ability, when the topic was 'academic
research', so really all the value gained from interaction from you
was from your one-on-one involvement.

... What I can say is that the facilitation that you provided
throughout the process I underwent has impacted on my life. Hence the
"what I learnt" had significant impact to the positive so hence I
could only conclude that you were very successful in making an
extended change to my business practice through the process of my
learning facilitated by your teaching.
