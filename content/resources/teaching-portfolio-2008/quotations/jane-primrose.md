Peter's teaching style is quietly coaxing the best out of his
students. This style is highly unique to Peter in our University
environment, and helps all students in their important final year to
find their stance on important theoretical issues.

For me, Peter's teaching allowed me to find my voice which was a
little to quiet to speak up, and helped me to gain the confidence I
needed. His help out of the classroom has also been unparalleled, and
he has offered me a significant amount of guidance in my final year
