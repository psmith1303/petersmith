Peter is my lecturer for the 'Strategy' course. Compared with other
courses I have done in the Postgraduate Diploma, I find that the
quality of Peter's teaching is outstanding. This is based on the
following reasons:

-   The teaching environment was relaxing and creative, with
    different types of music playing as background sometimes
    (different from all other courses I have learnt);
-   The teaching methods were innovative and challenging for some
    students, as we had to discuss at the class about a particular
    case and find out the best strategy among ourselves (no heavy
    reading, traditional PowerPoint lecturing);
-   Peter performed as a facilitator rather than a lecturer. He
    strongly engaged students in active discussion about a
    practical business issue. (different from other courses, most
    students felt that we had to own the course and alter the ways of
    on-class discussion in order to maximise the learning)
-   Peter also gave students constructive and effective feedback in
    terms of further improvement in the course. (due to the small size
    of the class, nearly every student got individual in-depth
    feedback during the course.)

The outcomes are:

-   I enjoyed the class more and more as the course went on. Different
    from other courses, I really looked forward to attend the class
    every-week;
-   The use of in-class discussion has enhanced my communications
    skills and forced me to think the topics deeply and quickly.
-   Students had to use all the previous knowledge learnt including
    economics, finance, law, etc. to represent their ideas about
    strategies.
-   I also got on well with other students in the course, from the
    examples used by other students, I was able to learn from others
    and share some of my experiences with them.
