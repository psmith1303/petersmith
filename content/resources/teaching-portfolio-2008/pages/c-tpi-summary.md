- The Five Perspectives

Each of the paragraphs below represents a different perspective on 'good
teaching,' as indicated by the large bars on your profile sheet.
Together, they will help you understand and interpret your profile. Keep
in mind that these five are not mutually exclusive perspectives. In our
research involving thousands of teachers, the vast majority hold one or
(sometimes) two dominant perspectives. Many hold an additional 'back-up'
perspective that is high, although not dominant. This combination of
dominant and back-up perspectives allows teachers to accommodate changes
in context, content, and learners. Common sense requires that no one can
operate from all five simultaneously, since they represent contrasting
and sometimes competing views of teaching. On your profile sheet you
also have sub-scores for Beliefs (B), Intention (I), and Actions (A)
within each perspective. These sub-scores scores will further help to
identify your philosophy of teaching by highlighting whether your views
within a perspective are grounded (differentially or equally) in what
you believe, what you intend to accomplish, or what educational actions
you undertake in your teaching settings.

- Transmission

> Effective teaching requires a substantial commitment to the content
or subject matter.

Good teaching means having mastery of the subject matter or content.
Teachers' primary responsibilities are to represent the content
accurately and efficiently. Learner's responsibilities are to learn
that content in its authorized or legitimate forms. Good teachers
take learners systematically through tasks leading to content
mastery: providing clear objectives, adjusting the pace of
lecturing, making efficient use of class time, clarifying
misunderstandings, answering questions, providing timely feedback,
correcting errors, providing reviews, summarizing what has been
presented, directing students to appropriate resources, setting high
standards for achievement and developing objective means of
assessing learning. Good teachers are enthusiastic about their
content and convey that enthusiasm to their students. For many
learners, good transmission teachers are memorable presenters of
their content.

- Apprenticeship

> Effective teaching is a process of socializing students into new
behavioral norms and ways of working.

Good teachers are highly skilled practitioners of what they teach.
Whether in classrooms or at work sites, they are recognized for
their expertise. Teachers must reveal the inner workings of skilled
performance and must translate it into accessible language and an
ordered set of tasks which usually proceed from simple to complex,
allowing for different points of entry depending upon the learner's
capability. Good teachers know what their learners can do on their
own and where they need guidance and direction; they engage learners
within their 'zone of development'. As learners mature and become
more competent, the teacher's role changes; they offer less
direction and give more responsibility as students progress from
dependent learners to independent workers.

- Developmental

> Effective teaching must be planned and conducted "from the learner's
point of view."

Good teachers must understand how their learners think and reason
about the content. The primary goal is to help learners develop
increasingly complex and sophisticated cognitive structures for
comprehending the content. The key to changing those structures lies
in a combination of two skills:

(1) effective questioning that challenges learners to move from
relatively simple to more complex forms of thinking, and (2)
'bridging knowledge' which provides examples that are meaningful to
the learner.

Questions, problems, cases, and examples form these bridges that
teachers use to transport learners from simpler ways of thinking and
reasoning to new, more complex and sophisticated forms of reasoning.
Good teachers adapt their knowledge to learners' levels of
understanding and ways of thinking.

- Nurturing

> Effective teaching assumes that long-term, hard, persistent effort
to achieve comes from the heart, not the head.

People become motivated and productive learners when they are
working on issues or problems without fear of failure. Learners are
nurtured in knowing that.

(a) they can succeed at learning if they give it a good try; (b)
their achievement is a product of their own effort and ability,
rather than the benevolence of a teacher; and (c) their learning
efforts will be supported by both teacher and peers.

Good teachers care about their students and understand that some
have histories of failure resulting in lowered self-confidence.
However they make no excuses for learners. Rather, they encourage
their efforts while challenging students to do their very best by
promoting a climate of caring and trust, helping people set
challenging but achievable goals, and supporting effort as well as
achievement. Good teachers provide encouragement and support, along
with clear expectations and reasonable goals for all learners but do
not sacrifice self-efficacy or self-esteem for achievement. Their
assessments of learning consider individual growth as well as
absolute achievement.

- Social Reform

> Effective teaching seeks to change society in substantive ways.

From the Social Reform point of view, the object of teaching is the
collective rather than the individual. Good teachers awaken students
to values and ideologies that are embedded in texts and common
practices within their disciplines. Good teachers challenge the
status quo and encourage students to consider how learners are
positioned and constructed in particular discourses and practices.
To do so, they analyze and deconstruct common practices for ways in
which such practices perpetuate conditions that are unacceptable.
Class discussion is focused less on how knowledge has been created,
and more by whom and for what purposes. Texts are interrogated for
what is said and what is not said; what is included and what is
excluded; who is represented and who is omitted from the dominant
discourse. Students are encouraged to take critical stances to give
them power to take social action to improve their own lives and the
lives of others. Critical deconstruction, though central to this
view, is not an end in itself.
