(1) The new feedback system does not report faculty averages to
lecturers  
(2) Unfortunately, the other lecturer needed to relinquish supervision
of 50% of the students. Reading the qualitative feedback it is
apparently that this one fact alone negatively influenced my own scores,
as the forms were sent to the whole class and not just the students I
supervised.
