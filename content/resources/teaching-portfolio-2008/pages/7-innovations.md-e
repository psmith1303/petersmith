## Blogs

On-line journals (web logs or 'blogs') have become a popular way for
people to express their opinion on issues, and as a way to share their
reflections. As part of my teaching I have encouraged students to share
their work and their reflections through a web-site I run called-[The
Reflective Practitioner](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/).
Based on an idea from Dartmouth ([DartBlogs](http://dartblogs.com/)),
which in turn was based on an idea from [Harvard
weblogs](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/), this web-site allows students
to keep an on-line journal. The evidence from the web-site's logs and
from student feedback is that the journals are a very popular way for
students to understand one another better. Although many students are
too shy to commit themselves to "paper" as it were, some students have
continued their journals even after leaving the class and the university
(much in the same way as the Harvard weblogs are available to alumni as
well as their current students).

## Case teaching
Although not widely used in Faculty of Business & Economics, the use of
case teaching is prevalent at many business schools. I have adopted case
teaching with both my undergraduate and MBA classes. This takes the form
of guided analysis and discussion with marks being awarded for student
participation. I have successfully used this form of teaching with
classes ranging from 12 to 100 students. As can be seen from student
feedback, once they understand the purpose and have had some practice in
the method, they find it an enjoyable and reward method.

## Business Simulations

For over five years, I have been using the business simulation [Mike's
Bikes](http://www.smartsims.com/), both with first
year students and with stage III students. The simulation is used as a
practice field for students to experience being part of a
multi-disciplinary management team. The simulation is a core part of the
course, rather than being an adjunct to it. Thus, all the learning and
teaching is centred on the simulation and the problems that the students
encounter in managing their own team and their own company.

## Online teaching portfolio

I have started to [share](http://www.petersmith.org/)my teaching
philosophy, as demonstrated by this journal, my research work, and my
reflections on teaching with my students through the use of on-line
journals or blogs.

## Electronic marking

Having used _Cecil_ for a
number of years to advise students of their grades I was interested in
going one step further and mark their work online. Fortunately,[Turn It
In](http://www.turnitin.com/) also allows for the electronic marking of
students' work. I have trialled this system with my students, and whilst
they liked the immediacy and detail of the feedback process, there are
some infrastructural problems that prevent me from adopting this; 
specifically, we are too far away from the servers in the USA and so the
response is insufficient for it to be practical.

## Peer Feedback
One of the facilities available through using [Turn It
In](http://www.turnitin.com/)is peer feedback. Once
students have submitted their work to Turn It In, it is possible to set
up rubrics that allow students to review and critique the work of their
peers. I have used this for a number of years in the course *MGMT 302  
Business Policy & Strategy* and it is widely liked.

## Turn It In

Having attended a seminar in Melbourne on plagiarism I was luckily
enough to meet with John Barry, the founder and CEO of [iParadigms](http://www.iparadigms.com/). 
One of the products that iParadigms produces is [Turn It
In](http://www.turnitin.com/), a tool that checks the
originality of students' work. Since then I have be actively promoting
the use of similar products and routinely use Turn It In in all my
classes. Besides running teaching seminars on the subject I have
provided advice to the university's Quality Office. I have also provided
advice and support to a number of departments outside of Business &
Economics, e.g. Theology, Engineering, and Philosophy

## Information Literacy Program

In the BBIM, as part of the core management papers, an Information
Literacy programme was put in place with Lynne Mitchell of the library.
Besides being delivered in-person and on-line by library staff, this
collaboration entailed customising a program of learning so that it
directly related to the management material being taught and was
explicitly linked to subsequent assessments.

## Academic Honesty Assistance

I led the development of the Academic Honesty Assistance tutorial, also
known as _AHA_ with Lisa Callagher
and Lynne Mitchell. This tutorial provides about four to six hours of
instruction and assessment on Academic Honesty.

Many tutorials on plagiarism focus on what 'must' be done, and the
penalties for non-compliance. This tutorial is different, because it
develops an understanding of knowledge building culture of the
University and so it focuses on 'why' it is necessary to be academically
honest. The tutorial then provides tools and strategies to assist the
student with that goal.

The tutorial has been tested with a large stage I class (900+ students),
and has been found to have a positive impact on increasing the level of
academic honesty, and thus reducing the level of activities such as
plagiarism.

The development of AHA was funded by a $10,000 Teaching Improvement
Grant. Currently, other departments and faculties are looking at
adopting AHA.

## On-line student evaluations
Traditionally, evaluation of staff by students has been done using 'pen &
paper' through CPD. In the second semester of 2004 I trialled the new on-line
system provided in conjunction with CPD and _Cecil_.

This system allowed quicker feedback from students about their concerns,
and thus I was able to make adjustments in my teaching to address those
concerns. Prior to using this system, time delays meant that adjustments
could only be made for subsequent classes and not the current class.

### On-line auctions

In 2003, as part of *MGMT-301 - Management Theory & Practice*, we (the
teaching team) wanted to have an experiential exercise for the students
based on 'virtuality'.

It was decided the classic 'Dollar Auction' exercise would be moved into
the virtual world. And so, I wrote a small web application that would
allow the 'Dollar Auction' to take place in real-time and on-line.
Subsequently, we used the exercise with a class of about 80 students.
The experience was quiet different to the face-to-face version, and
provided rich experiences that we were able to successfully debrief.

Since then, we have also used the exercise as part of a short course in
virtuality.

### TestGraf
For *MGMT 302 - Business Policy & Strategy*, students are assessed each
week using a bank of multiple choice questions. These questions are
delivered to students in-class
using _Cecil_.

Having written over 600 questions there is, nevertheless, the lingering
question, "Do they work?".

This is where I have
adopted [TestGraf](http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/faculty/ramsay/TestGraf.html) to
carry out statistical analysis of the questions. This analysis allows me
to diagnose problems with whole tests, individual questions, and items
with a question. Consequently, I have strong evidence of the quality, in
terms of discrimination and validity, of questionnaires I have written.

My use of TestGraf has been so successful,
that _Cecil_ have incorporated TestGraf's main
functionality into Cecil's test engine.
