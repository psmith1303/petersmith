My aims and objectives in teaching have been formed by three things.
Firstly, there are those people who, as my teachers, began to shape the
way I think about teaching. Secondly, there is the experience of others,
often presented as theory, which has broadened my understanding of how
people think and learn. Finally, there are my own experiences as a
teacher of what has an impact, what has little impact, and what does not
work.

## Those teachers who shaped my thinking about teaching

One of my first tertiary teachers was Warrant Office Steve Rollinson of the Royal
Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Steve always gave people room and
time to experiment and make mistakes; but he did so without attaching
blame. Furthermore, given the environment (the British Army), he did
that without putting people at risk. Thus, my teaching is grounded in
safely allowing people to try things out in a way that doesn't
necessitate them "getting it right" the first time. Later, Wim van der
Bospoort, (formally of Philips Data Systems, and now with Microsoft)
was, at first, my teacher and later a friend of over twenty years. Wim
awoke in me a passion for "finding out". Whereas Steve was quiet, even
reserved, Wim was enthusiastic about both his subject and about learning
itself. With Wim, everything was used as an opportunity to learn. In
addition, it I was delighted when I realised that as I was learning from
Wim, he was learning from me. And so, I always try and demonstrate
passion and enthusiasm in my teaching. I try and take every encounter
with a student as a chance for both of us to learn, whether that is in
the class or even when the student is voicing a complaint. More
recently, Darl Kolb, of the University of Auckland, began as my teacher
on the MBA program. He subsequently became my mentor when I joined the
faculty at Auckland, and he too has become my friend. Darl approaches
his teaching with modesty and humility. As such, he is an exemplar of
the "guide on the side, not a sage on the stage" approach to teaching.
For me, this had led to a desire to guide students to their own answers,
rather than having me dispense "wisdom".

## The experience of others e.g. as theory, which broadened my understanding

The phrasing of the previous statement is imbued with my
experiential approach to teaching. Whether cast as David Kolb's learning
cycle, George Kelly's creativity cycle, or Argyris & Sch&ouml;n ideas on the
reflective practitioner/double loop learning, the element that they all
have in common is learning through reflection on experience.
Contemporary authors, such as Roger Putzel
with [XB](https://sag.sagepub.com/cgi/content/refs/34/4/512) (experiential
organizational behaviour), continue to feed the my enthusiasm for
experiential learning. Thus in my teaching I seek to have students learn
by reflecting on their own experiences---whether those are experiences
arising from work in the class room, or from life outside of the
academic environment. Contemporary ideas such as life-long learning are
just modern expressions of older ideas such as Kelly's *man the
scientist* [sic]. Perhaps one of my greatest sources of learning has
been through the Organizational Behavior Teaching Society, in the guises
of its conferences (OBTC) and its Journal of Management Education (JME).
As I have written [elsewhere](https://www.petersmith.org/journal/), JME is
a constant source of learning for me, which allows me to improve my teaching.

## My own experiences as a teacher

It is, perhaps, my own experiences as a teacher that have had the biggest impact on me. Each time I go into a
classroom, there is a risk of failure, and the risk of a student not
learning. And so I am indebted to the students who learnt as I learnt,
and who were tolerant of my failings and mistakes. Through the efforts
and feedback of hundreds of students I have learnt that everyone is not
the same and what works in one instance can be an unmitigated failure in
another. More importantly, I have learnt the importance of the *teachable moment* 
and to seize it whenever and wherever it occurs.
This currently plays itself out in my reflections to students on my
learning as they reflect back to me their learning
through [The Reflective Practitioner](https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/) website.

# My purpose in teaching

Before discussing my aims and objectives in teaching, I think it is
necessary to address the issue of what is my purpose in being a teacher.
Why do I choose to teach? Some would say that the job is underpaid, and
often it can be a thankless task. So, again, why do I teach? Once upon a
time, my answer would have been "Because I'm good at it". But, being
good at something is not a reason, in itself, to do it. The real reason
that I teach is that I want to make a difference; I have chosen to make
New Zealand my home and my country and having made that choice I want to
contribute positively to the society in which I now live. Thus, I use my
ability as a teacher to try and make a difference. This, somewhat lofty,
goal has implications. In the first instance, it means that learning is
about changing people's behaviour, rather than the surface learning of
information; it is embodied through students doing things differently
than they otherwise would have done. The consequence for teaching is
that you cannot **make** people learn; teaching becomes the provision of
opportunities from which students can choose to learn. In the second
instance, learning and hence teaching is not an easy process as people's
beliefs and values necessarily have to be challenged in order to bring
about new behaviour, and inevitably some people will not want to change.
Finally, there is a need for the learning and teaching to be relevant to
the student in the wider context of society. The lever to achieve this
is to make teaching more than just 'knowing' a subject, it is about
broadening the way students think and see the world. In this I am
possibly old-fashioned; for me, the primary goal of teaching at
university isn't about "tooling up" managers or potential managers; it
is not vocational in that way. Teaching at this level is about helping
others to have an experience that helps them to make more informed
choices in the world in which they live.

*In summary, my purpose in teaching leads to the broad aim of providing
the opportunities for students to extend their thinking so that they can
make more considered and informed decisions and judgements about the
things that they choose to do*.
