My typical teaching responsibilities can be illustrated by the following
three courses that have formed the majority of my teaching during the
last few years:

* MGMT 302 Business Policy & Strategy
* MGMT 301 Management Theory & Practice
* MGMT 101 Organisation & Management

These three course offer different contexts for teaching, and for which
I have very different responsibilities for the students and my peers and
the university.

*MGMT 302: Business Policy & Strategy*, is a course that I have taught
for over five years. As coordinator for this course I am responsible for
the design and deliver of the course, the assessment of the students,
and for the supervision of the teaching assistant. Thus, I am
responsible for the quality of the course. As a final year course in the
BCom program, it is intend to be a capstone course. This is a medium
size class, and typically has between 30--80 students.

*MGMT 301: Management Theory & Practice*, is also a final year course
for many students in the BCom program. I co-teach this course with Darl
Kolb. This means that we take equal responsibility for the assessment of
students, the design and deliver of the course, and for the supervision
of the teaching assistant. Although the size of class is medium to large
(that is 60--120 students), by co-teaching the class we are able to
structure it as small class environment, typically working with 5--6
students at a time. Like MGMT 302, this course forms part of the major
offered by my department.

*MGMT 101: Organisation & Management*, is a core course in the BCom
program, and consequently it is compulsory for all students, regardless
of their chosen major. As the course is compulsory, up to 1,000 students
are enrolled each semester and the class size is typically between 100--
200 students. Given the number of students enrolled in the course, it is
taught by a team, of up to 5 teachers, with support from a team of
tutors. The course is managed by a full-time course coordinate. Thus, in
this course, I am one of a team of teachers. Thus, whilst I am
responsibility for delivering the course, I am also responsibility for
keeping the content largely 'in-sync' with what the other teachers are
doing. The teaching team and the course coordinator decide on the design
of the course and the assessment.
