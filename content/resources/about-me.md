I am a teacher and lecturer at
the
[University of Auckland](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/ "The University of Auckland"),
where my main teaching and research activity is in the field of
strategy. I am particularly interested
in
[Strategy-as-practice](http://www.strategy-as-practice.org/ "The special interest group for Strategy as Practice") (a
practice-based view of strategy), *Professional service firms*,
especially engineering firms, and *Innovation as strategy*, especially
technology roadmapping (TRM).

My consulting activity is focused on strategy for high-technology
firms.

I my spare time, I can be found
enjoying
[running](http://smashrun.com/peter.smith/ "The stats on my running"),
and drinking coffee.


For more detail regarding my teaching, have a look at
my [Teaching Portfolio](/resources/teaching-portfolio-2015/). It
outlines my perspective and approach to teaching, along with what I
actually do. However, it is a little out of date.

I also do a some running, thanks to the encouragement
of [Andrew](http://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/).

In what little spare time I have, I have been looking
into
[the history of my family](http://genes.petersmith.org/ "The families of Peter Smith and Lisa Woolsey").

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the areas in which I consult are general
management, strategy, high-technology firms, and professional service
firms (especially engineering consultancies).
