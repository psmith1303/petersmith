Oh joy. I got a response from [[https://evgenykuznetsov.org/en/reactions/2022/re-010053443/][Evgeny]]. Now I need to sort out my workflow for responding to responses.

To answer your questions, my directory structure is using =page bundeles= with each section (blog, notes, pages, etc) having all my posts, like this:

I'm no =Go= programmer, so I didn't try and play with your code, but if you think it could be an easy job .... â˜º

Regarding =sed=, yes I played with using 'index'. I couldn't figure out if there was much of a performance hit, especially as I'm using the single big JSON file. If you/we/us could get your tool working with my directory structure, I'd happily switch to using 'index'. It would simplify the tool chain, wouldn't it.
