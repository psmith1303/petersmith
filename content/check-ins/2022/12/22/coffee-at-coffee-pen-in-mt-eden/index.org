A tiny coffee shop that is really busy at lunchtime … so I had a bit of a wait. But as always it was worth it.

I also enjoyed a slice of their homemade ginger loaf (which I had eaten by the time the coffee arrived).

A side note, the Council is trying to label this area as Uptown —- a purely made up name, so I’m sticking with saying I’m in Mt Eden (just).
