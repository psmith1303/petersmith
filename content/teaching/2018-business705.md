An introductory course for those about to undertake their first research project of any real size.
<!--more-->

This course considers the selection of qualitative data, the analysis of qualitative data, the presentation of the results of qualitative analysis, and the notion of a qualitative mind-set.

Importantly, the focus of this course is on the practice of qualitative research---actually doing it---rather than reading about the various tools and techniques.
