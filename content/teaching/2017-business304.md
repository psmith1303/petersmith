Strategy is more than thinking strategically; it is more than planing; it is more than commanding implementation. Ultimately, strategy is about getting other people on-board with what you want.

To do that, you need to be able to express your ideas in a way that gets others to buy-in to them. Often that way is verbal, rather than through written reports. Consequently, this is a case-based course were much of the activity takes place through students discussing their positions (plans, insights, etc) on a variety of strategic issues.
