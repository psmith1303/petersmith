Today is spring graduation here at the University of Auckland. I always enjoy graduation, as it is a chance to celebrate the success of our students; and to be reminded of the students I have taught. It is great to see them walk across the stage.

This ceremony was different for me, as today I received my University Teaching Excellence award for Innovation in Teaching. One of my students, Jessica C-B, read a citation summarising her view of my impact on her learning. Her comments were very touching.

Considering the size of the audience, I think she did a marvellous job of presenting. Few people every have to talk to such a large group (I would say, several thousand).
