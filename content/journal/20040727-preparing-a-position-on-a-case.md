I just received a brief email from a student asking how to prepare
for Friday's case.

That really is a hard question to answer because I don't know what the
student knows about preparing a case. I could tell them all I know, but
that probably wouldn't be helpful as the student wouldn't have an
organising framework and it would be disconnect from their own
experience and knowledge.

Not only that, I hope that this course is developmental. I've said it
elsewhere, but my expectation is that students will become more
skilled at _doing a case_ over the duration of the course. Thus,
what is good now, might be considered poor later in the course. There
are pros and cons to this approach. Amongst the pros are; 1) it allows
students to develop a sophisticate approach to cases, without
having to _know everything_ or _analyse everything_ at the
beginning, 2) it allows good work to be rewarded appropriately
throughout the whole course--this is important because whilst at the
end of the course, students may _know everything_ right now they
don't; and since they are assessed each week it could penalise them
for not knowing it all, and finally, 3) it allows students to become
their _own_ strategist rather than conforming to some
normative/prescriptive/formulaic expectations.

The biggest con is that the target is moving; and this can be
unsettling. How is it that something that is okay one week, is poor a
month later? I think the way to deal with this is for students to
constantly evaluate the performance of the best students in the
class and comparing it with their own performance. I've found that
students are very capable at spotting who is 'best' in the class.
Generally, it is a good practice, in this class, to constantly be
marking ones own performance. If anyone has other thoughts, I'd be
really keen to hear them.

Anyway, I think the best way for that student to move forward is to
prepare a case, and then come and talk to me about it--that way, I can
give guidance on what will make the biggest difference for that
student, rather than spending hours (days, or weeks) writing down all
I know. So generally, if you want help with cases, be it with regard
to preparing on presenting them, then come and see me once your have
had a go at preparing it.
