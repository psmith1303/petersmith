Paula Jarzabkowski (2004) has recently had one of articles
published in Organization Studies. Her article is based on an
earlier [working
paper](http://research.abs.aston.ac.uk/working_papers/0212.pdf) she
wrote a few years ago. Good on her for getting it in to a tier-one
journal. As it happens, Paula will be visiting the
[department](http://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100505010923/http://www.business.auckland.ac.nz)
in November and will be giving a couple of seminars. If you're
interested in strategy (and who isn't), then I would commend her
seminars to you.

Anyway, as I was reading her article, my attention was drawn to:

> Mir, R., & Watson, A. (2000). Strategic
management and the philosophy of science: The case for a
constructivist methodology. _Strategic Management Journal_,
21(9), 941--953.

The abstract for Mir & Watson article goes like:

> In this paper, we suggest that constructivism has the
potential to inform research in strategic management. The realist
paradigm currently dominates strategy research, and
constructivism, a well-established tradition in the philosophy of
science, is often ignored. However, a study of strategy literature
and research reveals that it is drawn upon more frequently than is
explicitly acknowledged. Constructivism occupies a
methodological space characterized by ontological realism and
epistemological relativism. Ontological realism is an important
cornerstone of a field as applied as strategy, while
epistemological relativism helps us explore the constructed
nature of the field, where the researcher is an active participant
rather than a reactor or information processor. In this paper, we
demonstrate the precedents and possibilities for
constructivist research in strategic management. We examine some
of the existent constructivist works in the strategy literature,
and point to specific techniques, including historical analysis,
to demonstrate how this perspective may advance the boundaries of
strategy research.

For the constructivists, researchers are seen as skillful
craftsmen \[sic\], much in the same way as strategists are seen in
strategy-as-practices (no wonder Paula used this article in her work).
Whilst there isn't total agreement as too the nitty-gritty of
constructivism, Mir & Watson say there is agreement on six main principles, viz:

- Knowledge is theory driven
- The separation of researcher and the phenomena under investigation is not possible
- The separation between theory and practice is not equally unfeasible
- Researchers are never 'objective' or value-neutral
- Research occurs within a 'community' of scholarship where mutually held assumptions are deployed to create 'conversations'
- Constructivism constitutes a 'methodology' \[rather than a method\]

It is interesting to counterpoint _constructivism_ with
_realism_. Citing Leplin, the authors say that realism is
typified by ideas such as:

- the best theories are those that are close to the truth;
- the truth of a theory explains (and is the only explanation of) its predictive validity;
- we are moving progressively towards a true account of a phenomena
- the claims made by any theory are either true or false
- only through the deployment of 'reason' can a theory be proven or refuted

It's interesting to contrast (and compare) those views with [my
own[({{< relref "20040825-what-use-is-theory.md" >}})
about theories. So despite having some constructivist
tendencies, there are still elements of realism in the way I think.
Nevertheless, I do reject the notion that there are abstract
universal principles[^1] when it comes to research.

As it happened, I used this article as an opportunity to revisit my
understanding of classic research issues of ontology[^2] and epistemology[^3].

I liked the quote from Foucault that was used:

> We must not imagine that the world turns towards us a legible
face, which we would have only to decipher; the world is not an
accomplice to our knowledge; there is no prediscursive providence
which disposes the world in our favor. _We must conceive analysis as
a violence we do to things, or in any case as practice which we impose
on them_ (emphasise added).

That strongly reminded me of David Thomas'es _clues_ or _cues_ comments.
Anyway, this will be a helpful article when I write the method
chapter of my thesis.


[^1]: Nomothetic, by another name.

[^2]: Ontology--a theories of objects and things. More
particularly, what things are knowable and what things can't be
known. Main types of ontology are empiricism, rationalism,
pragmatism, constructivism.

[^3]: Epistemology--regarding the truth or falsehood of
knowledge. How can we prove if something is true or false (given what
we can know... ontology). I hope I've got these round the right-way.
