After class today, a number of people came up to me and asked if the
format of the class, in particular the type of questions I asked,
would be the same each week.

I think my opening question on the Telecom Case was something like,
"In 1999 would you have bought shares in Telecom?" A simple question,
but to answer the question well it is necessary to have a sound
understanding of the situation Telecom found itself in, and the
problems it faced. Anyone, who had a prepared position on the case
should have been able to provide a robust answer to that question (and
some did).

We then sort of plodded through the [BCG](http://www.bcg.com) /
[Mintoesque](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0960191038?v=glance)
approach of _situation, complication, solution, and impact_.
I doubt we will tackle a case using this approach (in this course).
Firstly, using a structured approach, like this, is useful for those
who find it hard to know _where to begin_ with a case. But, in future,
students will have a larger body of theory and experience on which
to draw. In fact, each case is can be well address based on the
readings for the week.

Actually, now I say it I wonder what Mason & Mitroff would have to say...
