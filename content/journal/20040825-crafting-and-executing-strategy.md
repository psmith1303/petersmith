I've just finished reading:

> Thompson, A. A., Strickland II, A. J., & Gamble, J. E., (2004). _Crafting and
executing strategy: Text and readings_ (14th ed.). New York, McGraw-Hill.

The preface of this text books says it aimed at the senior-level or
MBA student, and so I'm considering it as a replacement for MGMT 302: Business
policy & strategy, because our existing text book is no longer available.

As this is the 14th edition, you can tell it has been around for some
time (looking at the frontispiece, it looks like it first came out in
1978). The book is quite unitarist in its views. For example the
question "What is strategy?" (let alone "Do strategies actually exist
at all?") is answered in a straight forward manner, with none of the
nuances or dilemmas that something like de Wit & Meyer (2003) or Mintzberg, 
Lampel, Quinn, & Ghoshal (2003) insist on presenting. The emphasis
of the book is largely on the _content_ of strategy with little regard
for the _process_ or _context_ of strategy. Consequently, the book
does go somewhat 'against the grain', in as much as the mandate of the
course is to focus on the process side of strategy; whereas, [International
Business](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/index.cfm?fs=pgv&pageid=3621)
 to be more focused on the content issues.

That's not to say the book is bad; far from it. It does the job it sets
itself admirably--it's just not what is needed for MGMT 302
