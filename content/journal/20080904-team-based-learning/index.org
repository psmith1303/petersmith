I have seen the future and it's name is "Team based learning"

Today, I went to [Larry Michaelsen's](https://www.ucmo.edu/x4262.xml)
seminar on [Team Based Learning](https://www.teambasedlearning.org/)

He was impressive. Next year I will redesign one course around Team
Based Learning (yes, it was that good).

I have been using a range of elements in my own teaching, that are
compatible with Team Based Learning. However, it is clear to me that
Larry has spent much more time thinking about his teaching than I have
(he is, after all, an emeritus professor and has been using this
approach for 25 years). So, I think he has a much more robust way of
connect the elements together.

A few notes:

He has written a few
[books](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Larry20%20Michaelsen&page=1)
many of which are about Team Based Learning.

Apart from the main :Team Based Learning web-site", information can
also be found [here](https://www.tlcollaborative.org/ABOUT.HTM).
