One of the most useful tools coming out from last week's reading by
Ohmae (1982) is the idea of determining the critical issue. In many
ways, _this should be your initial goal as you tackle any case_,
including this week's case on United Parcels. Is the 'solution' provided
by scenario planning actually a remedy for a symptom rather than a real
solution--why might an organisation change its approach to strategic
planning?

And yet, given the reading by Mason and Mitroff (1998) on wicked
problems, the idea of finding the critical issue may seem
counter-intuitive. Given that wicked problems comprise of interlocking
networks of problems is it feasible to identify _the_ critical issue?

For me, the answer has to be yes: As one engages in the necessary
analysis around identifying the critical issue, one necessarily also
traverses much of the network of problems.

So, my opening question on Friday will be along the lines of 'What is
the critical issue at UPS?' Good answers will framed towards a solution
and provide a robust justification of why it is the critical issue.
