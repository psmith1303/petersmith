I received and email today from Baris to let me know he has a
[blog](https://barisinhk.blogspot.com/). Baris was one of the students
from Maastricht University who competed in the [MMICC](https://www.mmicc.org/) in March this
year.

His site lead me to [Manu's
site](https://manuelkoser.wordpress.com/2006/06/04/recap-mmicc-competition-in-montreal/\#more-8)
who was also part of the Maastricht team.

The interesting thing about the Maastricht team was that many of the
students were from Germany (rather than the Netherlands). That's a
bit like our own Valeria Biurrun and Christian Zaum, who I think are
also Germans who studied at Maastricht (and are now studying here at
[Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/ "The University of Auckland")).

They, Valeria and Christian were part of the team--with Lincoln Kyne,
Pravin d'Lima, and Barbara Wilkinson--that competed in the
[regional round](https://web.archive.org/web/20061008041108/https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebcontent/index.cfm?fs=pgv&seminar_ID=1229&pageID=29) of
the BCG case competition. Alas, in this postgraduate compeition the
two teams that were placed were from AUT and Canterbury.
