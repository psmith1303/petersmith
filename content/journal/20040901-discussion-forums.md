As requested, I think it was by Helen, I've opened up a discussion on
Cecil to allow you to exchange ideas with one another about the up
coming written case analysis of Carl Zeiss Jena (CZJ). I hope you find it useful.

If it is useful, I was wondering if you would like me to do the same
thing for the remaining cases? I would imagine it would work
something like this--a student could choose to discuss the case using
the discussion forum on CECIL _or_ discuss
the case in class. It would be one or the other, and the online
discussion would have to be complete before the in class
discussion. What do you think. If there is enough interest we'll talk
about it in class on Monday (after the break).

Furthermore, I'm also thinking about the assessment criteria for
the written case analysis. I'd like to get your ideas on that topic too.
(Of course, if you don't want to leave it until Monday, or if you'd
rather write down your ideas, then leave your comments-here).
