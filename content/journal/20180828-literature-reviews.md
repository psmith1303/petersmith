There is a lot already written about 'doing' a literature review. So,
why this note? Mainly, I did it to remind myself about the types of
literature reviews and the processes by which they can be undertaken.

Unless otherwise noted, this is mainly a summary from Huff's excellent
book, *Designing research for publication* (2009).


There are four main types of literature review: survey, critical,
systematic/synthetic, and supportive.

## The survey literature review

The survey approach is most useful as one seeks to get an initial
handle on a new area of research.

## The critical literature review

## The systematic literature review
