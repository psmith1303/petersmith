So looking at the brief results below, the question is _How did Enron
have profit that is greater than their sales?_ (After all, their profit
as a percentage of sales (after tax) was 231%)


| Firm | Sales ($,000) | Profit ($,000) | Margin (P/S) |
|-------------|------:|------:|----::
| Enron             | $11,970 | $25,421 | 231% |
| Balistique Bikes  | $85,921 | $15,004 | 18%  |
| Breakaway Bikes   | $96,944 | $11,825 | 12%  | 
| CIFO Bikes        | $63,739 | $11,792 | 19%  |
| On Track Cycles   | $93,467 | $7,998  | 9%   |
| Ballistic Bikes   | $64,773 | $6,982  | 11%  |
| Queen             | $86,655 | $6,753  | 8%   |
| Tire Kickers      | $33,820 | $1,298  | 7%   |
| Zoom Bikes        | $49,587 | $790    | 2%   |
| Smart Cycles      | $24,822 | -$240   | -1%  |
| Ultimate Cycles   | $29,238 | -$6,538 | -22% |
| Revolution Cycles | $17,796 | -$7,455 | -42% |

Well the answer is probably that they are sucking cash out of Zoom.
However, what isn't clear is _would it have been better to leave the
money in Zoom?_

Other pundits are wondering how Zoom feels about carrying the 'dead
wood' of Enron. (As an aside, Ballistic, who were previously owned by
Zoom, are now worth 25% more than when Zoom sold them). Even more
interesting is the low (or very low in the case of Enron) RO of the former BE
companies

And what will happen when Balistique stops pumping cash into
Ultimate Cycles and Revolution Cycles--is it a case of good money
after bad? Will they be able to catch up with Enron.
