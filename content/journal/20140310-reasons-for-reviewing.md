In his article 'You can lecture, but can you teach', Sotto (2010) argues
that trying to learn how to teach before understanding how people learn
is "like giving an answer before one has heard the question". This has
resonated with me. Consequently, I am looking for a book on learning in
the context of higher education that I can use as the basis for the
'annotated bibliography' task. Most of the books I have found thus far
are handbooks--comprising of chapters by various authors--and so a
coherent theme is hard identify. This will make staying within the limit
of 250 words an interesting challenge.
