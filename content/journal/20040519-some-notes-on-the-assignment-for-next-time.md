It's strange the things that stand out in this recent assignment.

Firstly, many people chose to use the _360 degree feedback_ type of
forms. This is fine, but a disproportionate number of people
emphasised the topic of emotional intelligence field. My guess is
that came from peoples previous experience with EI or EQ in MGMT 201. 

As Darl said a few weeks ago in class, to many people are engaging with stage I
topics and not moving into the stage III content of this course. I suspect 
that, as a consequence, they are often engaging at a stage I _level_,
rather than at a more sophisticated stage III level. e.g. So, 
did anyone who focused on EI or EQ consider that it
is a socially constructed map (possible based on other, more
established, personality factors from the [big
five](https://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/psychology/big_five.htm))?

Anyway, I think for next time we should remove that topic from the
survey and replace it with something else.

Also, people are not indicating on their cover-sheets to which team
they belong--despite it being in the _Black book_[^1]. For next
time, Darl thinks we should put a sample coversheet in the black
book.

I'm not sure if this will make a significant difference to the
problem. Having said that, a number of people seem to have slavishly
copied the form (and even the style of the opening paragraph) from the
essay exemplars in the Black Book. I, on the other hand, think it is
just a mater of some negative reinforcement (e.g. explicitly
taking away marks). I wonder which is would be more effective.
"Comments anyone?"
