I subscribe to a number of journals, so every week or so, something
new to read appears in my mail box. It's often hard to keep up with the
volume of reading (and I'm not even reading some "standards", such as
AMJ). Anyway, the latest edition of _Strategic Organization_ has 
landed on my desk. I've recommended it to the library but judging by
the library's catalogue it isn't generally available
in the University.

Each issue contains an editorial essay, and I thought the
following one would be very useful to my strategy students (albeit
for later in the course). The article is called:

> Delacroix, J. (2004). Another monkey on our backs: Falsehoods and
truth about globalization. _Strategic Organization, 2_(3),
313--322.

Unlike the readings in the MGMT 302 textbook, which argues about
the tension between globalisation and localisation, this article
focuses on the bad press that globalisation has been getting
(as _demonstrated_ at Seattle, Cancun, etc).

Having read the article, I can't help feeling that like the myth of
globalisation as a source of
[evil](https://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/25/046.html) (as it is
portrayed on many
[websites](https://www.google.com/search?q=globalization+evil)) needs to
be properly considered, rather than accepted (as politically driven
rhetoric). It reminds me of the claims that the pace of change is
faster than ever before ... I'm still waiting to see the _hard_
evidence.
