As we move towards a new semester, Darl and I are pondering "When is
the best time to rollover the simulation?" In our
[class]({{< relref "20040308-mgmt-301.md" >}}),
we use the business simulation [NetMike](https://www.smartsims.com/)
as a practice field for our students. Typically we simulate
between seven and ten years. Each simulated year occurs when we
_rollover_ the simulation to a new year.

In the past we have done the rollovers every Monday at mid-day or,
alternatively, at 4:00 on a Friday. Thus each simulated year takes
a week in real time. The advantages of doing the rollover on a Monday
is that it allows teams to meet over the weekend to make their
decisions. However, do we really want to encourage students to work
during the weekend? Are we facilitating bad habits? That is why
we have also tried to have rollovers on a Friday, so that students are
constrained to stay within the _working week_, so to speak.

On top of that, I suspect that when we have a Monday rollover, some
students are being 'coerced' into working at weekends when they would
rather not. I'd be interested to hear from past and current students
as to what their 'take' is on this-issue.
