When I first came to New Zealand, I went to a meeting at New
Zealand Post in Wellington. I parked my car just outside their
building. The meeting went well, but when I left the building, at
4:30, I couldn't find my car. It was gone. As I looked around I round I
say a sign--I'd seen it before, but I wondered if it was connected to
my disappearing car. It said, "Clearway, Mon-Fri, 4:00pm--6:00pm".
I'd seen the sign when I parked, but we didn't have clearways at that
time in the UK, so I didn't know what it meant. I was wrong. I shouldn't
have parked there. Eventually, I tracked down the company that had
towed my car, paid the fines, and got my car back. It was my own fault.
I accepted my mistake. It was one else's fault. I didn't feel I was
hard done by. Actually, I was sorry that I had probably caused some
traffic problems. If I didn't understand the signs I should have
asked. I didn't go around saying "Before I entered this New Zealand
they should have told me everything about it". Rather, I learnt my
lesson (and learned more about the NZ Road Code), and moved on.

I would hope that all of the students I spoke to about price-fixing
would agree that I was unambiguous in saying 'pricing-fixing would not
be tolerated'. Some of those students would have heard that in Exec
Meetings. Some of them would have heard it during one or more of the
summits. Some of them would have heard it in one-on-one discussions.
So, there is a pool of people out there who know that price fixing will
not be tolerated (whatever that means). In the 'real world', even here
in New Zealand, there have been a number of price fixing cases in
the local news. (Let alone, Enron is the US.)

Perhaps, some students had also read about price-fixing in the
press.

So, I think there were enough clear signs around.

If any of those students was unclear as to what price-fixing looks
like, why it is important in a market based economy that prices are
not fixed, or what are the penalties for price-fixing (either in the
simulation or in the real world), they did not make themselves known
to me. I have no idea what responsibility they took to clarify the
matter and what responsibility they accept for what happened.

Likewise, mechanisms, against monopolistic behaviour (e.g.
takeovers that would lead to dominate market positions) are built
into the simulation, and yet, not a single student have ever
questioned me as why they are there.

To often we rely on learning by our mistakes (see the Kolb Cycle), but
we don't always have to 'suffer' that way--we can notice the
signposts and ask what they mean.

The reliance on the Commerce Act, in DPE's 'Commerce Commission',
was not as a source of detail; Our intent was to make people think, we
should have known all of this. Rather, it was to show that we were not
being arbitrary in our actions--that it was really a serious
problem, not just in the simulation but also in the real world.

Finally, I wonder, if any team in Brazil wins, and gets the 5 per cent;
will any other team believe that they won it fairly (despite the
penalty).
