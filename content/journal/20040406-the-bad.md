When it comes to marking, one of the hardest parts is dealing with
the problem of plagiarism.

What I try to do, is rather than deal with the intent (which is almost
impossible to prove one way or the other; and, interestingly enough,
is explicitly disregarded by the University's policies), is to look
at the simple mechanics of "is it clear to me where this idea has come
from" and "is it clear to me whose words I reading"? That is to say, is
it unambiguous to me (through the normal requirements of academic
writing in this department (i.e. "AP":http://www.apastyle.org/) who said what?
This is reflected in the policy on "AP":http://www.apastyle.org/ referencing[^1]
that is detailed the 'black book'. Thus for me, the issue isn't "has
someone tried to pass off another persons words or ideas as their own",
but "are the mechanics of citing other peoples ideas and words
correct?" And so it is on the mechanics of referencing rather than
on plagiarism itself that I usually seek to address the issue.
Now no one is going to lose all their marks for failing to indicate
from which page a quotation was taken. That is trivial. At worst, I'd
probably make a remark in the margin. _But_, for me, in the
previous example, it does have to be crystal clear that it is a
quote
in the first place. There are no shades of grey. [The Publication
Manual of the American Psychological
Association](http://www.apastyle.org/pubmanual.html) (aka the AP manual ? or AP bible)
is unambiguous on this too.

Why referencing is important is a whole other discussion. As, an
aside, and ignoring the obvious answer about marks, I wonder
consideration you have given the following types of questions:

- Why is referencing important?
- What are the institutional reasons for requiring references?
- What are the social imperatives for referencing?
- How does referencing reflect 'our' concerns with scientific thinking?

In any case, it is important and academics (and dare I say,
students[^2]) are required by honour, and by the university's
policies, to act when the problem is identified[^3].
Of course, for those who run afoul of such policies, it can never be a
simple issue of mechanics. I doubt, when "confronting the brutal
facts":http://www.jimcollins.com/lab/brutalFacts/index.html, that my
rationale means much to those affected. When faced with forgoing 10,
20, or even 30 per cent of their marks, rarely is it a matter of the
student saying "Yes, I got that wrong." How many marks doesn't seem to
matter; even for five or even three per cent most people, when in a
situation about loosing their marks, will fight tooth and nail to keep
them (or some portion of them).

From this side, I face two difficulties. Firstly, I always assume the
students have _done the right thing_ with regard to referencing.
And so, my starting position is to trust the assignment that is
turned to me. However, once that trust is broken in one place in an
assignment, it is broken for the whole of the assignment. I have
neither the time, nor the inclination to consider and check every
single word and phrase to see if it is trustworthy. There is no
realistic way for me to check an assignment. Even a system, such as
"Turn It In":http://www.turnitin.com, might pick up only 30 per cent of
material that is copied. The only time can I be sure that it has found
all the copied material is when Turn It In says that 100 per cent of an
essay is the same other work.

Trust is important. I've seen almost every variation of
replication of material. Whole essays taken entirely from the web or
an electronic journal. A 2,000 word essay consisting of 60 other
sources spliced together, not a single original word by the essays
author. A badly written essay from one semester, based on a person's
individual reflection, where the 'new' version has just changed the
names of the people and team involved. These are the extremes -- but it
happens, more often, on a smaller scale. One paragraph copied from a
friend or a journal, half a dozen sentences stolen and scattered
through out an assignment. And, so on. If trust is gone, what do I
rely on?

The second issue is, _what is fair for the class and everyone who has
gone before_? I'm not sure that there are any straight forward
answers here, other than to trying and be consistent.



[^1]: Referencing, in this context, should be taken to mean the
    process of indicating the source of ideas and words (or even
    pictures and sounds -- in fact any one else's work) in your own
    work
    such as academic essays, a computer programs, a drawings,
    figures,
    musical compositions, musical performances, and so on.

[^2]: The person who created "Turn It In":http://www.turnitin.com did
    so in response to his students' complaints about _other students who
    were cheating_. People who where spending a lot of time writing a
    good essay felt cheated, and considered that the quality of their
    degree was being eroded, when they saw class mates submitting 'bought'
    papers. (Oh, this is only a partial answer to the questions earlier on
    in this entry.)

[^3]: This has big implications. For example, last year an essay was
    found to be largely identical to one submitted the year before.
    Subsequent research found that both students had copied from the
    same
    article. As a result both essays where given a zero. One of those
    students had already graduated -- but getting a zero for that
    assignment changed his grade for the course from a C to D-, which
    meant
    that he failed the course he had completed, and thus his degree
    was
    taken back. Also, there was a case a few years ago, where a
    lecturer at
    [VCU](http://www.students.vcu.edu/rg/policies/rg7honor.html)
    found old essays on disk and decided to check them ? [As a result
    120, or so, students had their degree
    withdrawn](http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0105/10/bp.00.html)
