So, I say I _like_ feedback, and yet I have _comments_ disabled.

Hmm. I have a lot of good _reasons_ not to enable comments, but what
is really going on. Oh it sounds a bit like that I want to:

>  (a) be in unilateral control; (b) strive to win and not lose;
(c) suppress negative feelings; and (d) act rationally (Argyris,
2002, p. 212}.

So, from now, comments are now on[^1].

[^1]: To prevent _comment spam_, they'll be automatically disabled after some period.
