I've been delayed in putting up the list of reviewers because so many of the class have not labelled their journal entries correctly.

As I skimmed those entries, I was reminded of the [brown smarties rider](http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp). Almost very journal that was missing labels seemed to suffer from major flaws, such as:

* No clear problem
* No sense of what action the author will no take based on what they have learnt from last week
* A focus on what the team has learnt (or what they think the team has learnt) rather than their own learning.
* Being something more like a "Dear diary", than a reflective learning journal as described by Daudelin.

It is almost as if the lack of care in labelling their journal was mirrored by a lack of care in actually doing a journal (and in particular lacking evidence of doing the four steps described by Daudelin).

Now that I have fixed up most of the missing labels, move journals into the correct location, I can get on to assigning reviews. Of course, if you've posted your learning journal outside of the MGMT 300 space, then you won't be allocated reviewers (or be allocated as a reviewer).
