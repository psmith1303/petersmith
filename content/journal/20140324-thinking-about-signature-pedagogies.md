The article on 'Signature pedagogies in the professions' (Shulman, 2005) 
suggests that the professions--of law, accounting, and medicine--are 
underpinned by stereotypical 'styles' of teaching. These styles can be 
categorised by their _form of instruction_, their _dimensions_, and 
their _temporal patterns_. Shulman goes on to argue that change in 
those styles is likely to come about only through material change in 
the profession or radical change in the teaching technologies.

Before, I reflect of how my role as a teacher might be influenced by my
disciplinary background, I think it would be useful to put Shulman's
article in to some context.

Shulman has looked at what might be regarded as the classic professions.
These professions have achieved social closure (Freidson, 2001). That is
to say, profession has achieved the legal right to regulate the
profession. For example, NZICA--the New Zealand Institute of Chartered
Accountants--determines who might or might not call themselves a
Chartered Accountants; likewise the Institute of Professional Engineers
of New Zealand determines who might or might call themselves a Chartered
Engineer. These professional bodies also regulate and police the
profession more general. As a consequence, for example, NZICA specifies
what must be taught in an undergraduate degrees for graduates to become
Chartered Accountants. Indeed, much--if not most--of the teaching of
accounting students is done my staff who are themselves members of
NZICA, many of whom have significant positions within NZICA. This
situation that the professions have achieved vis-&aacute;-vis the control of
their work, is in many ways unique (von Nordenflycht, 2010).

Many of the issues raised in the article can be accounted for through
processes such as isomorphism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983) or through the
heterogeneous knowledge requirements that the professions exhibit
(Malhotra & Morris, 2009).

Therefore, one needs to question the applicability of if the
conceptualisation of signature pedagogies and their resilience to
pedagogical change beyond the 'serving sciences' (Greenwood, 1957;
Powell, Brock, & Hinings, 1999) of the law, medicine, accounting, , and
engineering.

Setting those concerns aside, what might the _form of instruction_,
their _dimensions_, and their _temporal patterns_ within my particular
discipline of strategic management (Cox, Daspit, McLaughlin, & Jones
III, 2012). Having said that, the topic of strategy is still contested
and some (see, for example, Pettigrew, 1992) still regard it as being
pre-paradigmatic (Kuhn, 1996). Indeed, even its parent discipline of
organisational studies is still engaging in 'paradigm wars' (Scherer &
Steinmann, 1999). This contestation is clearly illustrated in _Strategy
Safari_ which presents ten schools of thought found in strategy
(Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, & Lampel, 1998).

## Forms of instruction

There are three forms of instruction that prevalent in strategic
management. They are (1) case-based teaching, (2) lecturing, and (3) the
use of business/strategy simulations. Other forms are utilised, such as
team-based learning, or case competitions, but these are more marginally
employed. In case-based teaching assessment occurs through the public
demonstration of one's skill in strategic thinking and oral
argumentation. Likewise, with simulations there is also a public
exhibition of skill that often includes the ones ability to work as a
team. For most of the other forms of instruction assessment is typified
by the more private form of written case analysis.

## Dimensions

There are two deep structures found within strategic management. The
first relates to the notion of the CEO as the heroic strategist, as
typified by the work of Andrews (1971) or Ohmae (1982). These deep
structure are--especially in American schools of thought--predicated on
quantitative analysis.

The implicit dimensions relate to the classic debate in the field as to
shareholders versus stakeholders. This debate also plays out in regard
to what is valued: profit rather than corporate social responsibility;
advocates of the former often entirely ignoring the later.

There is also a debate around the degree to which strategy should/can be
planned and the extent to which it is emergent.

## Temporal patterns

Given the lack of control of the 'profession' by the discipline, it is
perhaps unsurprising that many practitioners of strategy may entirely
bypass any discipline based education. Instead they may acquire learning
through experience, or through practitioner orientated publiciations.  If
there is a temporal pattern, it would be in relation to MBA programmes.
The original pattern was that non-managerial graduates would undertake
an MBA to provide them with their business, and strategic 'chops'.  Often
then moving in to areas such as strategy of financial consulting.

There is, nevertheless, this is some disquiet in some areas regarding
the signature pedagogies as exemplified by books such as 'Managers not
MBAs' (Mintzberg, 2003).
