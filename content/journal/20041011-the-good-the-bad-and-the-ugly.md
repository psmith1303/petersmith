I think I owe my MGMT 101 class (in general) and some MGMT 
101 students (in particular) an apology. Things didn't go as well 
as I would have liked. On almost every measurement I use to 
judge my performance in class, I scored a 'Not very good'. So, 
I'm left sitting here reflecting on "What went wrong?" How did 
I manage to turn today's class into (what might generously 
be called) a farce?

It would be easy (but wrong) to blame the students. Whilst, it takes
'two to tango', I should have managed events better. The
responsibility for the class is mine.

But, before continuing, I hope the class will accept my apology for
my lack of professionalism this evening. And, to the students to
whom I was unfair, I hope you will accept this apology too.

So, what went wrong, and what have I learnt from this?

Basically, the class got lost, and both I and members of the class got
over excited by out positions.

I think that I took the subject (business ethics) too personally
(as opposed to too seriously). I've seen so many managers make
unethical decisions with no real consideration of the
consequences
of their actions. Furthermore, I've seen students do
likewise[^1]. And, often, I've been left to
pick up the pieces. Hence, when I saw the direction the class (or some
of it) were taking I got a little excited and very defensive.
Certainly towards the end of the discussion I was adopting the
classic "win do not lose" attitude that is talked about by Argyris
& Sch&ouml;n]. I was well and truly stuck in Model
I, and rarely ventured out into Model II.

So what could I have done differently? It would be trite to suggest
that I be more Model I. Rather, I think
[David Barry's](http://www.geocities.com/drdavidbarry/) admonishment
to slowing things down is good--if things had been slowed down I would
have had more time to think about what was happening and try and
change the direction.

My other reflection is this--ethics is a difficult subject. Not
hard, but difficult in that it can cause us to challenge some of our
fundamental beliefs, and that can always make for an 'exciting'
class.

[^1]: You can tell from that statement I'm not an ethical relativist.

[^2]: Argyris and Sch&ouml;n (1974) lay out is magnificent detail the
realities of defensive reason in organisations.
