The first (of many?) summits was held with the CEOs of the various
companies that inhabit the [Mike's Bikes](http://www.smartsims.com)
world. A little over half the CEOs attended, and all the regions were
represented.

Listening to them (I don't always do the talking), what struck me was
how similar the problems they face, viz:

- Not being clear on what their own role was; however, some people
were very clear on this.
- How to manage/support team members who are having problems;
either because they don't understand their role, or because they
aren't "putting in the work".
- What to do about an uncertain future.

There are enough resources (smart people) making up the CEOs that they
can probably deal with the first two types of problems themselves,
and I was very impressed that some of the CEOs intend to keep on
meeting. As I said at the summit, it is normal-in the outside
world-for CEOs to meet and discuss the issues that they are facing;
it's also normal for other professionals to meet and talk about
their shared problems.

The third issue is somewhat more difficult, because I think the
people's ability to tolerate (maybe even enjoy) ambiguity (aka an
uncertain future) is a characteristic of ones personality and
therefore its harder for people to _manage_ it. The most frequent
technique that people (in this class and outside) employed to deal
with this issue is to seek more information. At the _uncertainty of
the moment_ is "How will the teams be rearranged after the last
practice roll-over?"

Let's see, whilst not [MECE]({{< relref "20040810-mece.md" >}})
some of the ways that students have suggested might be used are:

- _Let's see if you really did learn anything, or were you just
lucky_: No change; everything is reset to just the way it was at the
start, same regions, same competitors.
- _Equity and equality_. Teams are grouped based on their rank after
the last roll-over.
- _The forces of chaos_: Some process of random allocation.
- _The brave new world_: New/more competitors, new regions.
- _You made your bed now lay in it_: The simulation just
continues the way it is, those who have an advantage still have an
advantage.
- _Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water_: Something 
innocuous reset (maybe the forces of chaos) but there some
kind of big change later on.

I wonder what the class would like to happen (and why)? What would be
a rational approach, that also had some logical consistency with the
real world?

Frankly, I've been a little caught out by the lengths some people are
going to in order to "work out" what might happen. I know of one CF who has tracked down four or five past
'winners' to see what they did and what DPE
(or the equivalent) did. I suspect that whatever I say at this
junction will make no difference at all to the rumour mill.

As the
[song](http://www.dorisday.net/The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much/Que_Sera_Sera/que_sera_sera.htm)
goes, "Que sera sera. What ever will be, will be. The future's not ours
to see. Que sera, sera."
