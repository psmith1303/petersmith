Day One, yesterday was a little too busy for me to make any notes.

But I suppose I should say something about it. Well, yesterday was the
first day of the new semester. I seem to have two really good groups of
students for my _Business Policy and Strategy_ class, and for
_Introduction to Business_.

The [case based](https://www.agecon.uga.edu/\~wacra/wacra.htm) format of
the strategy course often comes as a surprise to students.
Nevertheless, most are able to be very successful with it. It will
be really interesting to see how they do with the first two cases on
Thursday (*Edward Marshall Bohem* and *New Steel*). Both cases are a
great introduction to both strategy and the case method and come from
the [Mintzberg](https://www.henrymintzberg.com/) text book The [Strategy
Process: Concepts, Contexts,
Cases](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/0132340305/qid=1015286441/sr=8--1/ref=sr_8_7_1/103--5620435--4807860).

This is a really good text book which we have used for a number of
years. Having said that we are trying out [de Wit and
Meyer's](https://www.dewit-meyer.com/) text [Strategy: Process,
Content,
Context](https://www.itbp.com/strategy/dewitmeyer/dewitmain.html)

Both of these texts present a more pluralist view than is sometimes
found in some strategy texts. They also has a lot of (often
conflicting) readings from a large numbers of researchers in the
strategy field. The de Wit and Meyer text, in particular, sets up up
opposing views of strategy and explorers the dynamics of those
opposites.

In the Introduction to Business course I used an exercise called
Room 703. This seemed to warm the class up and provided a really good
introduction to some of the issues involved when working in-teams.

It's been a hectic day, but at last I've some time to work on my PhD
thesis.

Arrgh, Doug, Christine and I have been asked to submit a portfolio
to the faculty so that we can be considered for the [Tertiary Teaching
Excellence in teaching
award](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/circulars/awards/ttea.html). This is
very nice, but it is due at 9:00 on Friday. This is rather tight,
considering how busy the first week of teaching-is.

Well we have come up with a draft plan to tackle this--I just hope the
committed like it. I'll mind map it out this evening, and tomorrow
we can start some serious writing. (As an aside, I really like--and
use--Mind Manager as a tool to produce mind-maps.)

I had an automated call from Jetstream saying I was coming up to my
monthly ADS limit of 600Mb. On checking the
usage I found I was already 50Mb over ... I wonder why they are never
early on these things. Still at 20c a Mb I'm sure they like the extra
income.
