As some may know, we
([MER](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100505010923/https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/))
have a reading group. The book selected for today's meeting was:

Freidson, E. (2001). _Professionalism: The third logic_. Chicago:
Chicago University Press.

Thus, my reading for today is that book. Some parts of these notes are
shamelessly taken from my current PhD thesis draft.
By my calculation, when [Freidson](https://web.archive.org/web/20050829025939/https://itsa.ucsf.edu/~eliotf/)
wrote this he was 78. I hope that I can write as well when I reach that
age.

For Freidson, professionalism is used "to refer to institutional
circumstances in which members of occupations, rather than
consumers or managers control work? (2001, p. 12). Whereas,
'Market', refers to those circumstances in which consumers control
the work people do, and "bureaucracy' to those in which managers are
in control [of work]" (2001, p. 12). In taking such approach, to the
occupational control of work, the notion of autonomy looms large. And
in taking such an approach, he is harking back to his earlier work,
and the ideas of authors such as Johnson (1972), Brint (1994), and
Larson (1977).

Secondly, from this basic idea he derives five elements that he sees
comprising an ideal type of professionalism. This is not a return
to a trait based approach to definitions, but more accurately, it is
intended to serve as a stable standard by which to appraise and
analyze historic occupations whose characteristics vary in time
and place? (Freidson, 2001, p. 127). The five interdependent
elements he describes are:

- specialized work in the officially recognized economy that is
believed to be grounded in a body of theoretically based,
discretionary knowledge and skill that is accordingly given
special status in the labor force;
- exclusive jurisdiction in a particular division of labor
created and controlled by occupational negotiation;
- a sheltered position in both the external and internal labor
markets that is based on qualifying credentials created by the
occupation;
- a formal training program lying outside the labor market that
produces qualify credentials, which is controlled by the
occupation and associated with higher education; and
- an ideology that asserts greater commitment to doing good work
than to economic gain and to the quality rather than the economic
efficiency of the work (Freidson, 2001, p. 127)

Having said all of that, the heart of Fredison's book is really the
notion of there being three logics at work -- that of the free market
(and let the buyer beware), that of the professions (let the buyer
trust us), and that of the bureaucratic (let the buyer beware? I'm not
sure).

As [Catherine](https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/ccasey) says,
Freidson is unashamedly 'for' the professions. Actually, I'll just
drift in to talking about reading group for a moment, as it is
connected. Being professionals ourselves, the book was of
particular interest, as it highlights the types of issue we face
everyday with the competing imperatives of managerialism,
market forces, professionalism. It's a shame that more people don't
come along---but that is indicative, I suppose, of those competing
demands.

I agree with others in the group that we don't give students a good
understanding of the alternatives to the contemporary
"obsessions' with managerialism and the market. Perhaps we do need
to spend more time on the subtlety and applicability of the
professional form of organising.
