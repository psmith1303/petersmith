I'm about half way through marking the current assignment and
several trends are apparent.

Firstly, the question is about the issue of evolutionary or
revolutionary change. Many people are focusing on _what they would
do_, rather than looking at the issues of what sort of change is
appropriate for the firm. Many people deal with the
evolutionary/revolutionary debate in a somewhat perfunctory manner,
and show little depth of understanding of the subtle of the issues.
Instead, they follow Strebel's "decision tree" with out paying heed to
the supporting text/descriptions i.e. they have applied a
common-or-garden understanding to his decision tree, rather than the
more nuanced explanation in the rest of the reading.

Secondly, people focus on the strengths and weaknesses of of the
_content_ of the firm's strategy, rather than the strengths of
weaknesses of the change process (which feeds back into my earlier
point).

Thirdly, when people think (and write) about what they would do, they
try and fix everything. If you reflect back on Ohmae, what is the
central question that needs to be answered--how does this all fit
together (Mason & Mitroff?)? Why give a long "shopping list", with
little sense of priority or importance?

Finally, there is a clear guide in the question to use Rumelt (1980) in
to evaluate the proposed strategy. So far, no one has used Rumelt.
