I received the following email:

> Hi Peter,

> I'm just writing to try and clarify a point about the first

To which I replied:

> Hi Dan,

> Thanks for you email and your question it contains. I imagine

> I don't remember if it was the first lecture, or the second one, but
> I do recall taking about depth of understanding and the need to
> read deeply. I'm always nervous of using examples; too often, in the
> past, I've given an example only to find that 40% of the class take up

> The explanation of _group think_ in the stage I text book let's
> one know that the phenomena exists, but doesn't allow you to 'do'
> much with it--the text book isn't very helpful in a practical
> sense. The stage I text book (Organisational Behaviour), goes 
> further and describes it better, but it is still somewhat 
> superficial. So if you think your group, for example, is

> Janis's original work to get the 'full story' (and maybe
> read a few articles that draw on Janis). Then, having that deeper
