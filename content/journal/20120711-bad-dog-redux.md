It lives (again)!

[Bad]({{< relref "20060728-bad-dog.md" >}}) [Dog]({{< relref "20070223-bad-dog-2.md" >}})
is [back up and running](https://baddog.ac.nz "Off to Bad Dog").

At this stage, I have set it up to allow students to maintain blogs (as a
form of learning journals) and later I hope to get a wiki working again.

Bad Dog was taken down a few years ago, but since then there have been a
number of requests to liven it up again. Now that I'm teaching again on
_MGMT 300--Management in dynamic contexts_ (MGMT 300 is the
replacement course for MGMT 301, which was the course that was grounded
in using the Mike's Bike simulation as a _field of practice_) I have
had the time (and the imperative) to get it going again.
