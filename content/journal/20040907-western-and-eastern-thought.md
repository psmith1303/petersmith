I subscribe to a number of email lists, which is probably pass&eacute; in
this era of [RSS](https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html),
but anyway, one of the lists I regular read is MG-ED-DV, the ["management education and
development list](https://aom.pace.edu/lists/l-mg-ed.stm) of the
[Academy of Management](https://www.aomonline.org/). Last week, one of
the postings was by [Fred Nickols](https://www.nickols.us) and pointed me to a
[review](https://edrev.asu.edu/reviews/rev294.htm) of the book:

> Nisbett, R. E. (2003). _The geography of thought: How Asians and
Westerners think differently ... and why_. New York: The Free Press.

Having read the review, I really wanted to read the book, and so-- having 
navigated the vagaries of
[Voyager](https://voyager.auckland.ac.nz/) saying the book was missing,
I finally managed to get (and read) a copy. It was well worth it.

There are few books that really change the way in which one views the
world, but, for me, this is one of those books. I am already trying to
change a number of things based on the insights this book presents.  But
what are these insights?

I won't try and summarise the book here; instead, I'll just
highlight some parts that stood out for me.

The history of the Greeks on one hand, and the ancient Chinese on the
other; the way in which language is structured in most Indo-European
languages compared to the context driven approach of East Asian
languages feeds into two different ways of seeking the world--and
not just metaphorically seeing but literally seeing. For example,
show two similar pictures, Westerners will typically see more
changes in characteristics of the distinct objects that make up the
pictures e.g. they will see that an aeroplane has its landing gear
down in one picture but not in the other. East Asians, are more likely
to notice the change in relationship between things, e.g one
aeroplane is close to another than in the other picture. East Asians
are more likely to notice, and attend to, the difference in contexts
of situations; Westerners are less likely to do so.

This plays out in other ways too. Westerners have a history and a
culture of debate such that:

> Western rhetoric, which provides the underlying structure for
everything from scientific reports to policy position papers,
usually have some variation of the following form:

- background;
- problem;
- hypothesis or proposed position;
- means of testing;
- evidence;
- arguments as to what the evidence means;
- refutation of possible counter arguments; and
- conclusion and recommendations

\[This is also the structure of much of University work and of
academic journal articles--students
doing [Business policy & strategy](/categories/mgmt-302/) and those
who know the [Minto Method]({{< relref "20040810-mece.md" >}}), will
be familiar with such structures.\]

I feel that it will probably come a surprise to most Westerners
that such a "linear rhetoric form" is not well know or practised in
East Asia. Rather, there is a quest for the _Middle way_ which seeks
to find a path through conflicting/paradoxical positions.

This lack of understanding and practice of rhetoric plays it self
out in the class room during exercises requiring participation.
The demand lectures make (such as myself) is for students to play out
the rhetoric--to expose their stepwise thinking--and yet such analytic
thought is the antithesis of East Asian holistic thought that seeks to
encompass the whole (rather than by dissection). Thus, material is
often understood by East Asians in a non-verbal manner which makes
class discussion and debate almost impossible. For example, one
researcher:

> had people speak out loud as they solved various types of
problems. This had no effect on the performance of European
Americans. But the requirement to speak out loud had a very
deleterious effects on the performance of Asians and Asian
Americans. ... its practical implications are very important. How
should one educate Asians and Asian Americans in American
classrooms? Is it a form of "colonisation" to demand that they
perform verbally and share their thoughts with their classmates?  Would
it have the effect of undermining the skills that go with a holistic
approach to the world? Or is it merely common sense to prepare them
for a world in which verbal presentation skills, even if it might be
difficult to achieve them, will come in handy? ... the cognitive
aspects of holistic, dialectic approaches to reason .. are so
embedded in perception, philosophy, and even temperament that is
seems doubtful that much in the way of change could be achieved. But I
would be delighted to be proved wrong.

If I believe this, then I must necessarily try and change my teaching
practice. Thus my initial response to this, is to restructure some
of
[Business policy & strategy]({{< relref "20040901-discussion-forums.md" >}}) and
I'm still considering what might be helpful in _Management theory &
practice_.

Other interesting effects of the differences between Westerners and
East Asians is the fact that many "culture-fair" I tests may not be so
culture neutral. If East Asians are more sensitive to the relationship
between things and their context, as opposed to the Western approach
of categorising everything, then some I test are just plain unfair
(e.g. those tests that are based on picking things that are the same
as a previous sequence).

One early example in the book illustrates why this is a problem.
Students were given a pyramid made from cork and told that it was a
'Dax'. They were then asked to select from a range of other objects
which were also Dax. Most Westerners picked objects that were also
shaped like a pyramid. But, most East Asians picked objects that were
made from cork.

Anyway, enough said for now. I'm sure I'll return to this book as I
continue to reflect on-it.
