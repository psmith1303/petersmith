At a recent seminar series on learning and teaching there were a couple
of presentations on Graduate Profiles and on Curriculum Mapping.

A Graduate Profile describes what the _output_ of the University
should look like in terms of the attributes its graduates should display.
Curriculum Mapping is a process of matching what goes on inside of
courses to the aforementioned graduate attributes in the Graduate Profile.

In other words, its a process of showing how processes inside the
University connect to its outputs.

It all sounds very good.

And yet ...

... and yet I can find no evidence (empirical or otherwise)-to suggest
that either Graduate Profiles or Curriculum Mapping have any impact on
education outcomes. Do they-result in, say, either greater
effectiveness or efficiency somewhere?

I do not know.

So, I am left wondering if they are 'just' legitimacy exercises? Do we
do them because everyone else does them?
