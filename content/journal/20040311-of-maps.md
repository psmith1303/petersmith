I've been doing some prep (I was looking up some information on the
London Underground. In particular, see Tufte on the [Beck's map of
the London
Underground](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00005W))
for next weeks lecture, and I stumbled across
[Blog-Fu](https://www.simiandesign.com/blog-fu/2004/01/information_design.php).

Whilst that site is mainly about information design (Is information
design an oxymoron?. Can information be designed? I expect many
people may want to argue that point.) it does also link to the work of
[Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/). He was the person
who revitalised interest in Minard's stunning 'map' of [Napoleon's
March](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard).

It suppose it is at least two years ago that [David
Barry](https://www.geocities.com/drdavidbarry/) and I were talking about
these issues (of maps and meanings). Strangely, I had forgotten about
that discussion until I saw the Napoleon's March map again.

The maps that we have, either on paper or in our head, shape our
understanding of the world. I wonder how many people have taken a
half-an-hour journey on the tube (_The tube_ is the colloquial name
for the London Underground)) (changing trains or lines) because the
map indicated that was the most direct route; when it would have been
quicker in time, and shorted in distance to walk from the station.
The problem is that people forget that the map isn't geographically
accurate.

This applies to many maps we use. Whilst they are accurate on some
level, e.g. the connection between stations, the implicit
simplification that a map introduces also means that it must be
inaccurate at some other level (e.g. the physical distance between
stations).

It is this duality of maps, being accurate and necessarily
inaccurate at the same time that piques my interest.
