I think one of the most powerful readings of the course,
_particular at this point in time_ (with the Commerce Commission,
take-overs, insolvent firms, firms who are just realising that they
might not win) is the one that is indicated in the Black Book (and in
the Red Book?) by Jim Collins.

Alas, out of all the journals I've read today, only one person seems
to have made use of it (in fact no one else even mentioned it). Which
is strange, because last semester, I'm pretty sure that most people read
it (and it was 'advertised' much the same way). Is it a matter of
timing--were there just too many other things happening? Perhaps
you could let me know for next time.

Anyway, I recommend the reading to you.

(Oh, BTW, every time
I read this article I'm reminded of the Vietnam veteran in [Pulp
Fiction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/))
