Sigurd Olsson also did a pretty good essay. I think it is
interesting to compare and contrast it with the other two essays on
Carl Zeiss Jena that I have already posted here.

Once again, thanks Sigurd for letting me use it here as an example to
other students.

> ## Carl Zeiss Jena
> 
> In this assignment, I will perform an analysis of the case "Carl
> Zeiss Jena: Managing Catastrophe" by Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries and
> Marc Cannizzo. Utilizing factual information from the case, in
> addition to relevant theory and my own understanding, I will
> analyze the change path of Carl Zeiss Jena from 1989 to 1991. In
> addition, I will comment on main strengths and weaknesses of this
> process, and provide ideas for further strategic change in Carl Zeiss
> Jena's future. I will conclude by answering the question: "How
> revolutionary would be my approach to further strategic change if I
> was in Dr. Dierolf's shoes in October 1991?"
> 
> The change process of Carl Zeiss Jena between 1989 and 1991 was
> characterized by strong resistance forces and strong change forces,
> especially in the beginning of this period. The strongest change force
> came on the 9th of November 1989; the Berlin wall collapsed, and with
> it the command economy in East Germany. Within months, Carl Zeiss
> Jena found itself desperately trying to adapt to and survive in a
> market economy, and was facing a whole new socio-political,
> economical and organizational environment. This change force is
> strongest because it has the biggest effect on Zeiss Jena's current and
> future performance (Strebel, 1994). The current general manager of
> Carl Zeiss Jena, Wolfgang Biermann, left the company, and was replaced
> by Dr. Klaus-Dieter Gattnar, the deputy general manager. This,
> according to Strebel (1994), is another form of change force.
> 
> Under Biermanns' leadership, every decision needed his approval, and
> he practiced "management by fear". Being a true communist himself,
> he also refused any proposals suggesting change (Kets de Vries 
> & Cannizzo, 1992, p.999). Gattnar was quite
> different in his approach, stating: "You have to permit some chaos
> to encourage creativity" (Kets de Vries &
> Cannizzo, 1992, p.1006). At the same time, the resistance forces were
> also strong, such as the company structure and culture, which weren't
> easily adaptable to the new environment of operating in a market
> economy, and presented significant barriers to change.
> 
> In a situation like this, according to Strebel (1994), where strong
> change forces put pressures on a system with strong resistance, the
> result can be a breakpoint, where the change agent behavior
> overtakes status quo agent behavior. In Carl Zeiss Jena''s case,
> Biermann, with his closed mindset, was the status quo agent and
> representing a strong resistance force, preventing change, and
> Gattner was the change agent, promoting some change.
> 
> Biermann's behavior leading up to his resignation was also slowing
> down the change process, as change "requires the hands-on guidance of
> the CE" (Stalk, Evans & Shulman, 1992, p. 364). Tushman, Newman 
> & Romanelli (1986) also suggests that
> frame-breaking change (which I believe was needed at this point in time)
> calls for direct executive involvement. Without his involvement,
> there would be no change, and thus, he represented another barrier
> to change.
> 
> Gattnar's first decision was to decentralize some of the
> decision-making processes. I believe that this was a wise decision, as
> it reduces hierarchy (Hammer, 1990) and it also made it possible for
> Gattnar to focus on the "big picture" rather than being preoccupied
> with minor problems easily solved by others.
> 
> I believe that the change path followed by Carl Zeiss Jena up until
> this point was not as revolutionary as is should have been. It looks
> to me that Gattnar attempted to follow a combination of a
> resistance, renewal and partly also a revitalization path. I do not
> agree with this approach, due to the fact that the forces of change were
> strong, they could not be rolled back and there was little time
> available (the company had to adapt to a market economy as soon as
> possible in order to survive). According to Strebel (1994), this
> situation calls for a restructuring path, where the organization
> is given a sudden shock, focusing mainly on structures and systems.
> This view is echoed by Tushman et.al. (1986), who states that sharp
> changes in political conditions, such as the end of the command
> economy, calls for discontinuous change. I believe this would have
> been the right choice in this situation, rather than Gattnar's
> incremental change approach.
> 
> On the 1st of July 1990 the Treuhand (government privatization
> agency) took formal control over Carl Zeiss Jena (Kets de Vries 
> & Cannizzo, 1992). It converted Zeiss Jena from a
> "people's own enterprise" (VEB) to a limited liability company
> (GmbH) (Kets de Vries & Cannizzo, 1992). In
> addition to this, the Treuhand decided to split up the Kombinat,
> reducing Zeiss Jena's workforce from 70,000 to 27,000 employees.  This
> decision did lead to a more unstable supplier environment, but I
> still agree with the decision, as this would further bring Zeiss Jena
> away from the old way of doing things. The Threuhand also decided to
> shift the structural focus to product divisions, as opposed to being
> based purely on production facilities. I believe this was the right
> thing to do, as it according to Hammer's (1990) first principle of
> reengineering limits errors and bureaucracy and improves customer
> service. This structural change present another strong change force
> (Strebel, 1994). Even though the actions of the Treuhand was out of
> Zeiss Jena's hands, I still believe that they did the right thing by
> attempting to change the structure of the company, as Strebel (1994)
> recommends when going down the restructuring path. Tushman et.al.
> (1986) also suggests reorganization as a response to frame-breaking
> change. A major weakness of this approach was that it took too long; as
> time was limited this should have happened swiftly (Tushman, et.al.,
> 1986 & Strebel, 1994), and Gattnar should have
> initiated this straight away, when he first was appointed as the new
> CE.
> 
> Due to the replacement of the Ostmark with the D-mark, as well as
> other problems, their most important export markets (the former East
> Bloc) collapsed, leading to a 95% decline in orders received from
> them. Gattnar had only anticipated a 25% drop (Kets de Vries 
> & Cannizzo, 1992). Needless to say, this sudden
> change in Zeiss Jena's most established market represented a big
> negative turning point in Zeiss Jena's operation, further
> strengthening the change force (Strebel, 1994). I would have
> preferred Gattnar to have been a lot more proactive in his approach
> regarding this issue, as his overly optimistic estimate meant that
> Carl Zeiss Jena had to face this issue severely unprepared.
> 
> Just before this collapse, Carl Zeiss Jena and Carl Zeiss Oberkochen
> had begun to negotiate a unification of the two companies. As
> negotiations went along, the East German employees became
> suspicious of Oberkochen's motives, fearing that Zeiss Jena would
> become nothing but an "extended workbench" (Kets de Vries 
> & Cannizzo, 1992, p. 1004) for Oberkochen.
> 
> At the same time, the process of selecting who had to go began. This
> was done with a great deal of secrecy, and this lack of internal
> communication led to a lot of rumors. This is a major weakness in
> the change process leading up to 1991, as this failure to
> communicate, together with the distrust of the Westerners, lead to
> unwillingness from employees to cooperate, thus creating another
> barrier to change. Gattnar should not have kept his employees in the
> dark regarding what was going to happen with them and the
> organization as a whole, and should have strived to make sure that
> the workers understood that the changes being done and the help from
> the Westerners were necessary and vital to the company's further
> existence.
> 
> After 18 months of negotiations, an agreement to restructure Zeiss
> Jena with the help of Western management was reached between the
> Treuhand, Zeiss Oberkochen and the State of Thäringen. This plan
> included physically dividing Zeiss Jena into two companies, one
> keeping the name Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, the other one would be renamed
> Jenoptik.
> 
> Dr. Lothar Späth would take on the role as CEO, first for the whole enterprise, and
> after the restructuring for Jenoptik GmbH. Dr. Jörg Dierolf, agreed
> to be second in command to Dr. Späth. When Dr. Dierolf arrived in Jena,
> the situation facing him was rather chaotic. Gattnar and his top
> management team were still on board, but did not really have any
> formal power anymore, and they had done nothing to assist Dierolf at
> his arrival. Gattnar had also signed off a chaotic organization chart
> just before Dierolf arrived, without him being aware of it. This
> behavior on Gattnar's part is quite similar to Biermann's behavior,
> and thus Gattnar had gone from being a change agent to a status quo
> agent, posing as a barrier to change, just like his predecessor.
> 
> I believe it was a good choice to appoint Dr. Dierolf as a new
> executive, instead of keeping Gattnar, who had worked at Carl Zeiss
> Jena for 35 years and under Biermann's command for several of those
> years. My reasoning for this is firstly due to the fact that Gattnar
> was not functioning in his role, and secondly, by bringing in new
> executives, as opposed to keeping the old ones, "business-as-usual
> behavior" (Tushman et.al., 1986, p. 283) is avoided, and the
> business is provided with new ideas, skills and drive vital to
> successful change.
> 
> Dierolf quickly established himself as a strong leader. He swiftly
> reduced the unreasonably large "management committee" (Kets de
> Vries & Cannizzo, 1992 p. 1011), and I assume
> he also got rid of Gattnar and his men. He also appointed managers to
> the new divisions, and gave them full responsibility when choosing
> their own subordinates. I assume that this made it possible for
> Dierolf to focus on other issues, without having to worry about how
> these managers did their task, as "German workers do not
> necessarily need a manager to 'motivate' them" (Hofstede, 1993).
> 
> Morale in the 3rd quarter of 1991 was at an all time low, as was
> internal communication. Carl Zeiss Jena had taken a stakeholder
> perspective under the communist regime, catering for its
> employees, and the Jena region as a whole (Freeman 
> & Reed, 1993). Thus, employees did not expect to be
> fired, but 17000 people had to be laid off. This was not due to take
> place until October, so the company was rather idle in this period,
> as
> there was no incentive to perform.
> 
> To summarize my findings, it is clear to me that the right choice of
> strategic change path was not made by Carl Zeiss Jena. As explained
> above, the initial circumstances called for a restructuring of the
> whole company, but Gattnar attempted to renew and revitalize it,
> unsuccessfully I might add. When restructuring finally was on the
> agenda, implementation took far too long, leaving the whole
> company
> more or less idle. Top management did not have the support of the
> employees, as distrust, uncertainty and poor communication was
> present through the whole process. This created on of several
> barriers to change mentioned above, and strategic planning seemed
> non-existent. Instead top management seemed to take a short-term
> approach, thus creating an obstacle to effective strategic planning
> (Marx, 1991). The arrival of Dr. Dierolf signaled several positive
> changes, but he also failed to think ahead. In addition, he did
> nothing to improve the downsizing process and thus the low morale
> resulting from it.
> 
> In October 1991, the change forces were not as strong as they were 2
> years ago. I believe that the change forces are easily identifiable,
> and if I was in Dr. Dierolf's shoes I would have begun the change
> process by drastically improving internal communication, as well
> as starting to plan strategically for the future. This would
> hopefully reduce the number of status quo agents among employees, and
> turn them into change agents. The managers appointed by Dierolf could
> help in this process, acting as change agents for their respective
> units. This way, the organization would become more open to change,
> and instead of waiting for something to happen, I would have taken a
> proactive approach and initiated cascading implementation,
> where all levels of the organization were asked to change (Strebel,
> 1994).
> 
> Due to the fragile relations I assume I still would have with the
> workers, I would adopt a stakeholder perspective, i.e. I would
> value
> their input and cater for their needs (Freeman & Reed, 1993). 
> This could indeed be more expensive
> than adopting a shareholder perspective, but I believe it would pay
> off in the long run, as it is difficult to run a business
> successfully without the commitment of the employees.
> 
> Updating technology and equipment would also be a vital task, as
> the
> Western markets were used to better products than the Eastern
> markets. This would of course absorb a lot of financial resources,
> but would be vital to the survival of the company.
> 
> As wages were only 1/3 of western wages, it could be tempting to
> pursue a cost-leadership strategy, but I assume that wage levels will
> rapidly increase as they now are a part of the western world, so
> instead I would opt for a strategy of differentiation (Porter,
> 1985). If Zeiss Jena and Zeiss Oberkochen worked together, their shared
> core competencies in R&D and production
> would mean that they have the opportunity to offer a product that is
> better than their competitors.
> 
> As operating in a market economy would still be relatively new for
> Zeiss Jena, as this would not happen overnight, I suggest an approach
> of logical incrementalism (Quinn, 1978). This way, there would be no
> strict plans to keep up with, and as this was common under the command
> economy, I believe it is important to let people realize that things
> are done differently in a market economy. In addition, as
> unforeseen events may still occur, this approach is far more flexible.
> 
> My approach is clear and should not be misunderstood by anyone, thus
> it's consistent with itself. Of course, as I adapt a planning
> process of logical incrementalism, it is difficult to be certain
> about this. With regard to consonance, my approach is a response to
> changes in the external and internal environment. I believe this
> approach will create an advantage for Zeiss Jena, as the plan is to
> offer products that are better than others. If this is not achieved,
> the advantage is non-existent in that regard. Finally, my approach
> could overtax financial resources, as the updating of technology
> and equipment will be expensive, but I believe that the
> restructuring package funded by the Treuhand and the State of
> ThÃ¼ringen would cover this. Another question mark here will be whether
> Zeiss Oberkochen is willing to cooperate in the way I suggested
> (Rumelt, 1989).
> 
> In conclusion, I believe that the change path of Carl Zeiss Jena from

> should have been implemented much swifter. If I was in Dr. Dierolf's
