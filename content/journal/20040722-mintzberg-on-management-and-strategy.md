Yesterday, in MGMT 101--_organisation and management_, I was 
laying out some of the territory that the class
(and I, I suppose) will be covering in the coming weeks. For
whatever reason[^1], much of the course is structured around PLOC[^2]; 
planning, leading, organising, and
controlling. As I pointed out in class, this is not an accurate
description of what managers do. I mentioned that since the 1970s we
(academics) have had a much richer view of the work of managers. In
fact, I was alluding to the early (earliest) work of Henry
Mintzberg[^3].

Anyway,as I was reading today, I came across a nice introductionary
article to Henry Mintzberg. It's well worth reading by stage I
students, and is called:

de Holan, P. M., & Mintzberg, H. (2004).
Management as life's essence: 30 years of The nature of managerial
work. _Strategic Organization, 2_(2), 205--212.

Additional, the article shows the serendipitous way in which new
management ideas are 'discovered' and how they rise to prominence.
There is a link here for later--in future we'll talk about _In search
of excellence_, by Peters & Waterman. At that
time, remember to ask why the book was so successful.
Henry also makes a point of saying how hard it is to teach
management to those people who aren't managers--he is so right.
Until you've been there it doesn't make much sense. Management is a
practice (in Turner's sense) more than it is a science (or even an
art), and so there is a significant element of management that is
tacit (as there is in most parts of social life).
