Sometimes it's nice to use a video during a presentation. If you
want to use a video in PowerPoint, here are my top-tips.

- Make sure the file name is short, and keep the file in the same
 directory as the .ppt file.
- To put a video on a slide, use "Insert&rarr;Movie from file".
- To get videos from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) you can use
 the web-page from
 [TechCrunch](https://www.techcrunch.com/get-youtube-movie/). Save the
 file as a .flv (you'll convert it in the next step)
- Use the .wmv format. If you use .avi or .mpg, you often have to
 choose the "full-screen mode" to playback the video (otherwise,
 when you play the video you just get a black box where the video
 should be). If you want to convert the file,
 [Zamzar](https://zamzar.com/) is pretty good.

It's interesting that I'm increasingly relying on web services,
rather than installing applications. Once upon at time, I would have
installed an add-on to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/)
to be able to download the video. Then I would have installed a video
converter. But not now. It is often quicker, and more reliable to use
web services (if you are sure they are clean and not loaded with
viruses/spyware/malware).

There is even a nice [PDF
unlocker](https://www.ensode.net/pdf-crack.jsf) service for those times
you lose the password to a .pdf.
