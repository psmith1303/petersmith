The results from the first roll-over of [Net
Mike](http://www.smartsims.com) are available now. Until Monday, teams
will only know the results in their own world. I wonder what lessons
lessons are taken away from this first roll-over. How many people will
consider their assumptions confirmed? What will happen in those
firms that did not perform according to the managers expectations?

All over the know Mike's Bikes universe maps will be confirmed or
disconfirmed. Maps will be considered reliable or will be
discarded and new maps will be sought for.

On one level, I'm a big fan of the scientific method especially in
its guise of
[falsificationism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsificationism). As
an
aside, I occasionally teach a course called [Managing Science & 
Technology](https://ndeva.auckland.ac.nz/ndeva/course_catalog/Uofak/Science-General.htm).
At the start of the course we (it is taught by the faculties of
Science and Business & Economics) often ask
_What is the scientific method?_, and usually this is followed by
along silence in the class. Anyway, the rough idea of the scientific
method is that we develop theories about how 'things' work and test
those theories by look for proof that the theory is broken. For
example, if we believe that all swans are white, one approach to
proving that would be to look at swans. Every time we saw a white swan,
that would mean our theory was working. If we found a black swan,
we'd have to discard that theory and come up with a better one. Of
course, it would be nice to get all the swans together and check 
them all, but sometimes that luxury is not available.

As yet another aside, the expression _It is the exception that proves
the rule_ is often misused. The use of the word prove in this case is
similar to test; in other words, the expression should be _It is the
exception that tests if the rule [is right or wrong]_. Thus, if there
is an exception, then the rule is wrong (or incomplete).

Anyway, for a more complete explanation of falsificationsim read
about [Karl Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) and
[here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/).

However, what happens in reality is different. When asked to prove
something, people will seek confirmation rather than
disconfirmation. So, rather than looking for a swan that is not
white, people take every sighting of a white swan as further evidence
that they were right. So, if you want to know if the map you are using
is a good map, look for the ways in which it is wrong, rather than the
ways in which it is right -- then you'll know the limits of the map
(because we already know maps are wrong in some ways, and right in
others).

So, for example, if you believe that increasing marketing has a
positive impact, how can you prove it?
