I'm a little
[anxious](http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=anxious&x=0&y=0).
Okay it's not "extreme uneasiness of mind", but nevertheless I'm a
little tense ...

We had expected to have [Net Mike](http://www.smartsims.com) setup by
now, and to have emailed all the class with their login details. Alas,
it's Sunday and we still haven't been able to that. The 'whys and the
wherefores' of the situation, how it came to be, don't really matter
for purpose of this discussion. Rather than looking backwards, I am
more interested in reflecting on this moment, as it is now.

So, why am I anxious?

Well, I suspect that there are a number of students who are chomping
at the bit, waiting to get started. Some, I imagine, are keen and
enthusiastic and want to get going. Others will be still unclear on
what needs to be done and they will be hoping that getting started on
making the decisions for their firm will help bring clarity to the
task; i.e. learning through doing. Few, might be indifferent to the
situation; but I doubt it. Whatever the reasons, I expect, there will
be students who will be concerned at being unable to get into *Net
Mike*.

Notice the language of the last paragraph.

It is my anticipation of the classes reaction that is at the root of
my anxiousness. The interesting thing is that it isn't something
'real' that is causing this emotion. Rather, it is how I imagine
things will be. The class may be fine with the situation. I don't know
that. Nor do I know if they will have a problem with it.

But here's the strange thing. Now that I've mentioned it, it is more
likely to happen the way I anticipated it happening. Perhaps when
we get to the lecture on [the social construction of
reality](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385058985/002--8823839--3331201)
it will be worthwhile revisiting-this.
