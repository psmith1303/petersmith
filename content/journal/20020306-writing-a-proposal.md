I've been through the main documentation for the [Tertiary
Teaching Excellence
Awards](http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/circulars/awards/ttea.html) in some
detail. And, I've looked at the requirement our
[university](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/) has. So, now I think I have
a handle on the amount of work that is needed for this beast.

_Several hours later_ Well I haven't done much so far--in this area
it hasn't been a very productive day ... oh well, lets see what can be done
this evening.
