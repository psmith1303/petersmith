A quick guide to the BCG growth-share matrix.

I often find that students understand the concepts behind the BCG
growth-share matrix, but don't know what 'numbers' to use when 
'drawing' it. So here we are.

The BCG growth share matrix is a tool for the evaluation of the 
performance of a company that operates in a number of markets; 
i.e. it is a way to examine the portfolio of businesses in which 
the firm operates.  I have taken an illustration of the matrix 
from Hedley's original 1977 paper. The description of _stars_, 
question marks, cash cows, and dogs can be found in Hendley's 
paper.

There are a couple of things to note. Firstly, the y-axis is _Business
Growth Rate_. On this access, the dividing line between _cash cows_ and
_dogs_ (the bottom half of the matrix) is at 10%. In other words to be
a _star_ or a _question mark_, the business needs to be growing at 10%
or more.

The x-axis is the relative competitive position. It is a
logarithmic scale, of a firm's relative comparative position,
i.e. their relative market share compared to the best competitor
(not oneself). Thus, if my company has 20% market share, and my best
competitor has 10% market share, then my relative competitive
position is 20/10 which is 2. On the other hand, if my company has
20% market share, and my best competitor has 30%, then my relative
competitive position is 20/30 or 0.67. On the x-axis, the
difference between _stars_ and _question marks_ is that stars have a
relative competitive position of more 1.5. However, for _cash
cows_ and _dogs_, the difference is that _cash cows_ have a relative
competitive position greater than 1.

Of course, the numbers are only approximate. As Hedley (1977, p.13)
says, there is "no 'magic' that transforms a star to a cash cow as it
growth declines from 10.5 to 9.5 per cent". Indeed, all the lines are
just guides.

Finally, to convey the importance of each business being analysed,
Hedley recommends that the size of the circle represents either
turnover or the number of employees.
