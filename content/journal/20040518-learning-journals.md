I've been re-reading the articles for next week ahead of our usual
teaching meeting. In particular I've been thinking about Marilyn
Daudelin's article _Learning from experience through
reflection_.

Firstly, I've been wondering if this reading should be earlier in the
course; say during the first week. Would it make a difference to
quality of the journals that people have to do? (This is a very
different from the question "_Could_ it make a difference to
the quality of journals that people have to do?"). But then it struck me
--perhaps we should adopt _learning journals_ instead of 'vanilla'
journals. (There is plenty of information on learning journals on
the web. See [here](https://www.audiencedialogue.org/journal.html), 
[here](https://www.qub.ac.uk/mgt/itsoc/proj/learjour.html), or
[here](https://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/gyaccp/cjgh_27_2_05lores.pdf)--
these are just a few from a [Google
search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22learning+log%22+%22learning+journal)
--I didn't even attempt to find a quality source from somewhere like
the [Journal of Management
Education](https://www.ingenta.com/journals/browse/sage/j285)--and yes,
there are a couple of article there (one even cites Daudelin)).
So maybe in week one we could have student's read the _Learning from
experience through reflection_ article, do some research into
learning journals, and then write a _learning journal_ each
week from that first week.

My questions are: (1) would students learn more this way, (2) how
many marks, if any, should be associated with this task, and (3) would
students actually read more?

Anyway, I'd be interested in some feedback on this, so please "mail
me with your thoughts.

Having said all of this, and having read the _afore-linked_
articles above, including the two in [JME](https://www.ingenta.com/journals/browse/sage/j285),
I'm very tempted to do trial it. And so, a la Kolb (David A. Kolb, not
Darl Kolb), I prepare to go round the leaning cycle-again.
