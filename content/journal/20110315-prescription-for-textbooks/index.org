I've talked [elsewhere about the economics of
textbooks]({{< relref "20100104-the-economics-of-textbook.md" >}})
and my surprise at how much of the mark-up goes to the various parties.

Anyway, on [Boing
Boing](https://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/03/prescription-for-con.html)
there is an interesting article that discusses the issue further (and
provides some interesting links). The article says:

> 5. Student behavior
>
> a. Students basically function as a captive consumer audience, like the
> Joads having to buy from the company store in Grapes of Wrath. Only
> those with the means or ingenuity to obtain textbooks from alternative
> sources do so.
>
> b. 80% of students buy the faculty-prescribed books.

I don't think that it's that the students are captive in the way that
the article suggests. Rather, I suspect that, certainly as freshers,
they don't know enough to decide whether they should buy the textbook or
not. Anecdotally, by their third year, they are much more canny;
preferring to share, use the library, or even make copies of the
textbooks.

For the new [BUSINESS 101
course](https://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/courses/prescriptions/business/business.html)
that [Doug](https://web.archive.org/web/20100520025423/https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/5137.aspx),
[Chris](https://web.archive.org/web/20130504104850/https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz//5129.aspx) and I have
designed, we've moved right away from textbooks. Most (if not all) that
the students need is available through [the databases that our
library](https://web.archive.org/web/20130721110519/https://coursepages.library.auckland.ac.nz) pays
millions of dollars for access.

Having said all that, I do wonder to what extent textbooks act as
security blanket for students. Do they feel they are better off for
having one. I guess I'll find out (to some extent) when the course
kicks-off on Monday.
