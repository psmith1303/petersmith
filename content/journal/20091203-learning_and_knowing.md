For a number of months, [Lisa
Callagher](https://web.archive.org/web/20100513124031/http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/5272.aspx) and I have
been talking about theories of practice. We have both found the
discussions productive in sharpening our individual understanding of
theories of practice. However, I have not taken the time to note the
insights those discussions have produces. And so, the following few
entries are my attempt to crystallising into words what I have come to
understand. In other words this is my 'take' on our conversations, and
so all the biases, errors of logic, and so on are mine.

For the past few weeks we have been talking about learning and knowing;
what they are and how they relate to one another ... and how they are
connected to theories of practice.

Learning and knowing; why use gerunds (-ing)? Perhaps it comes from
from Weick's (1969) admonishment to so do. However, for me, it reflects an
underlying view that things can be learnt or known, rather they are
dynamic and contextually dependent, and so learning and knowing only
exist in the doing. Such a stance probably owes something to the notion
of _social becoming_ (Sztompka, 1991), but it is hard to judge exactly
what has influenced ones thinking.

What has, specifically, influenced my thinking is the work of Kelly
(1955) and his notions around personal construct psychology. Although
not as widely read/popular as other theories of personality and
thinking, 50-years on, I find his work compelling and largely consistent
with what we know from neuroscience. This probably means that I should
do a 'small' entry on PCP as it is known.

The desire to 'go back' to earlier principles is something of a habit
with me. I recall that when I was doing electrical engineering, in
examinations I could never remember the necessary formulas. So I would
always quickly work them out at the start of the exam; it just seemed
easier than recalling a rather abstract pattern of symbols, letters, and
numbers. Lisa has read some of my writing and comments that I've a
tendency to do a lot of 'definitional work'. I do tend to build up to
things. I also like to have the historical context of things too. I
rarely accept an idea without looking at where the idea came from. It
can make reading a slow process ... and writing even slower. Such an
approach is probably why I'm drawn to notions of situated action
(Suchman, 1987) and the like.

Anyway, back to PCP (eventually).
