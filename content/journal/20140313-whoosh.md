I'm currently working on a course with a colleague, Frank as--although
he is a content expert--we're using Team-based learning and I have more
experience in that teaching strategy.

The class kind of got away from me yesterday.

The first session each week is focused on what TBLers call readiness
assurance; an individual quiz and a group quiz. At the end of the group
quiz one is meant to talk about any learning gaps/misunderstandings that
arise through the testing process.

Alas, I didn't manage to do that part well (if at all). The students
were generally heavily engaged in preparing appeals for the questions
they thought were wrong. As a result I did not get their attention so I
then did not walk them through where their thinking was right and good
and where they did not understand the material well.

This I think may set up an unhelpful dynamic if it continues.

So, next time, I need to find away to get them to focus
collectively--rather than as individual teams--on the issues they had.
Perhaps I could be more bossy about it, or perhaps I need to explain
what I say happening and what might/is a better way for us (them and me)
to respond to the situation.
