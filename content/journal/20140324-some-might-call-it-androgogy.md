I already have an espoused [Teaching
Philosophy](http://www.petersmith.org/portfolio/3-philosophy/) that I make
available to all, but for this activity in ACADPRAC 701, I have sought to
set it aside and begin from scratch.

The starting point for any articulation regarding teaching begins with a
notion of what it means to learn. I have noted
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20140313-defining-learning.md" >}})
some of my current thoughts on teaching, however, on further reflection
I would amend that statement to say:

> Learning is the ability to use knowledge after a significant period of
> disuse
>
> and
>
> It is the ability to use the knowledge to solve problems in a context
> different (if only slightly) from the context in which the
information was originally learnt

Being something of a practice theorist (see, for example, Schatzki,
Knorr Cetina, & von Savigny, 2001; Schatzki, 2002; Turner, 1994, 2002)
and one for whom practice is an ontological/epistemological position
(Orlikowski, 2003), I believe that knowledge is socially constructed and
somewhat field/domain specific. Knowledge is typically what others--and
in particular insiders (Unruh, 1979, 1980)--regard as knowledge and that
any knowledge is somewhat contested. Thus, I accept an embrace the idea
that what is seen as knowledge in, say, organisation studies would not
necessarily be accepted as such in medicine. For example, the
characteristics of a _good_ meta-analysis are different between those
two fields. And yet, meta-analysis is used effectively in both domains
to solve problems. In other words, knowledge is situated (Suchman,
1988).

None of this would be controversial within my discipline/sub-discipline
other than, perhaps, some novelty in that I transfer my research
interests into my teaching interests. In discussions with colleagues,
there are few whose research interest underpin _how_ they teach rather
than _what_ (content) they teach; an example to the contrary would be
someone like Joe Realin (2009, 2011) who also uses the practice
perspective.

My next point of departure is that I focus on the teaching of
adults--_e.g_., say, andragogy--rather than pedagogy _per se_; for me
pedagogy (the teaching of children) has a different focus and
explanations ... and here we can loop back to the notion that knowledge is
field specific. The needs and abilities of adults, and the tactics and
strategies to foster their learning are often different to those that
are efficacious with children. Of course, I am cognisant that some of
those I teach may be in transition.

Having said all of that, I do seek to treat my students as adults. I do
tend to explain what I am trying to achieve with them (as in, in
conjunction with them). To that end, I will often make my teaching
strategies and tactics explicit to them.

To foster learning, my teaching frequently involves a significant amount
of repetition ... doing similar tasks over again. For example, when I
teach using the case method, we--the class--will do cases every week for
that learning to become deeply embedded and to allow for higher levels
of proficiency in 'doing' cases. Likewise, when using simulations there
is repeated engagement/use with the simulation, for the same reasons.

Generally, I think my teaching is both theory informed. What is less
evident from this discussion is how my own experiences--both as a teacher
and as a student, and as one who has moved from being a stranger (Unruh,
1979, 1980) a regular within my own field--have also shaped my thinking
on teaching. That, perhaps, is a reflection for another day; suffice to
say that those experiences are congruent with my theoretical
orientation.
