_Yes_

Because of Rochelle's bereavement, I had the class mark themselves
using a little table I'd prepared. I think the table did two things.
Firstly, it helped to structure peoples comments a little, and
secondly, because it explicit allowed only four attempts, it caused
people to be less forthcoming with 'off the cuff' remarks. In other
words, people's comments seemed to be more substantial.

And so the participation played out like this:

| |Week 2|Week 3|Week 4|Week 5|Week 6|
|-|----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| 1s| 20| 11| 14| 8| 3|
| 2s| 12| 14| 13| 12| 14|
| 3s| 2| 6| 3| 10| 9|
|Total| 34| 31| 30| 30| 25|

Note how few 1s there were... So the average marks for the class were
amongst the highest thus far.

If you want to see the total list for the class, have a look at the
extended-entry.
