generation doing a lot of multitasking. But I wonder where is the
evidence that they are any better at it than any other generation.

My sense is that multitasking does not seem to be something one can learn
to get better at ... there are some cognitive limitations. Perhaps
people become more tolerant about it, or perhaps--and perhaps more
likely--people who do a lot of multitasking naturally avoid the type of
activities that are not amenable to multitasking. In other words, the
channel themselves down routes where the negative consequences of
multitasking are less important. For example, if multitasking inhibits
creativity, is there a tenancy for those who multitask to avoid
activities where creativity is important?

I wonder what is the evidence.
