The course _MGMT 300 Managing in dynamic_ contexts kicked off today.  The
first class, of an course, is always filled with a little bit of
trepidation--both on my part, and probably on the part of some of the
students too.

I wonder if how many will try and game the team formation process. Time
will tell.
