Well I spent a happy hour from 16:00 to 17:00 yesterday collecting the
assignments from Commerce B, checking them against the class list,
checking the class list against the TurnItIn results, and sorting
them into teams ready for marking. That should only take 20 minutes or
so, but because some things are missing it takes a whole hour.
The complicating factors are that some people haven't handed the
paper copy of their essay in and some haven't submitted it to
TurnItIn. However, the main complicating factor is that some
students _still_ aren't putting their company name on the
coversheet.

Perhaps next time, we should have students hand in their results
from TurnItIn with their assignments. That way the matching will done
automatically by the students, rather than by one of us.
Anyway, I've taken the assignments of two teams home with me and have
started marking.

I've marking from MGMT 302 (Business Policy & Strategy) coming in 
on Monday so I have a strict schedule to meet if I'm going to get 
it all done in the required time.
