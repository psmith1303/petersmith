Lisa and I went to see [Marina Warner](http://www.marinawarner.com/)
give the first [2004 Douglas
Robb](http://www.alumni.auckland.ac.nz/2446.html) lecture tonight. The
topic was _After The Arabian Nights: Daemons & Alters_. After the 
lecture, I mentioned to Lisa that, for me, in delivering her lecture, 
Marina had achieved the holy trinity of breadth, depth, and humour. 
Often a lecture only delivers one or two of these[^1], but tonight 
we got all three in spades. Of course one might expect such a 
performance from a world class writer and academic, such as Marina , 
but, in the past, I have sometimes been disappointed.
As we walked onward to the car park, I began to reflect on how
difficult it is to comment on what Marina had said. The difficulty
comes from her use of words. The problem isn't in her choice of words,
or her vocabulary. Nor is it in the she marshals them and organises
them. The difficult isn't in _what_ she says or even how she says
it. At the heart of this 'problem' is the way in which she uses words
that to reveal _how_ she is thinking about her topic.

I don't know where I read it, but I recall that one of the greatest
difficulties encountered by academics doing inter-disciplinary work
is coming to terms with the way people in their 'non-main' discipline
think. The challenge is to understand the world in as others (in the
other discipline) do. For example, most of the content of what is
taught in [MER](http://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100505010923/http://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/)
isn't hard. The hard part is learning how to think like a manager, or
an academic, or a strategist, and so on. For those students who are
doing a double major, or a minor, or a con-joint degree, they must run
into this problem all the time. Knowing _what_ is the easy
part, knowing _how_ is difficult because managers do think about the
world different from scientists, differently from artists, etc.
[Stanley Frielick](http://www2.auckland.ac.nz/cpd/staffpages/SF-Breakthroughs.pdf)
talks about it like this:

>Declarative or propositional knowledge is typically the
> type of knowledge dominant in university curricula; the 'what' of a
> subject, abstract, conceptual, and concerned with labelling,
> differentiating and justifying. Functioning knowledge is
> based on performance of understanding in professional contexts?it
> involves the application of declarative knowledge in enacting
> skills and knowing when and why to perform them. Universities may
> espouse the development of professional functioning knowledge,
> but in practice the focus is on declarative knowledge which
> students often perceive as irrelevant and consequently adopt a
> surface approach [to learning].

The differences between the way in which groups (disciplines,
occupations, ?) think is manifest in the way Darl and I identify,
hopefully in a light hearted manner, engineers in the class. It
isn't _what_ they say, or even their behaviour that reveals them as
engineers. It is they _way_ in which they think about things that
distinguishes them (of course this isn't an exact 'science' and
sometimes we do misidentify some).

I believe that functioning knowledge is often learnt, alas at
university, through a process of osmosis; by seeing how others do
it, rather than being proactively taught. In fact social learning,
like this, is a crucial part of human development. Last week,
[Judith
McMorland](http://web.archive.org/web/20050307052941/http://www.colearnz.co.nz/) and I ran a sociodrama
[seminar](/blog/2004/03/11/sociodrama/)
for post graduate students. Before the it began, we had laid the room
out in the 'traditional' psychodrama[^2] manner, and we were sitting
talking. To my surprise, I realised that as we were talking we had
adopted the 'psychodramatic voice'. The particular rhythm and
cadence, together with the vocabulary of that has been evident (to
me) in every psychodrama training session I have ever attended. We
were being sociodramatists. For the seminar, we were adopt the
ways of thinking and the ways of acting that are dominant in the New
Zealand psychodrama community. The tacit, functioning, knowledge
was manifesting itself. No one has ever said to me, this is how a
sociodramatists talks, or this is how they think, or even, this is
how they see and understand the world. It is something that I have
been acquiring over time (and I think it is why I struggle so much to
make sense of sociodrama).

The way this plays out in class, and in assignments, is in the way
students seek evermore concrete definitions of what they are
required to know -- the quest of declarative knowledge, where as
lecturers are really looking for functioning knowledge. No wonder
the two sides sometimes fail to meet.

Earlier, I was talking with my Research Assistant about how, 
in MGMT 301, some people can identify the gender of applicants on 
anonymous CVs from the style of the writing. She is strongly of the 
view that this is a relative straight forward
procedure, as the handwriting can show,broadly, how the writer
thinks, and given that the genders think differently it isn't a large
step to guess the gender. We then discussed an extension of that,
whereby it isn't too hard to guess the general grade of an assignment
from the nature/pattern/type of references that accompany an
assignment. The references reveal, what sometime is called the
quality of thinking, but really is a measure of how much the author
of the assignment is thinking like an academic, or a manager, etc.
i.e their functional thinking. Some of these points are evidenced
[here]({{< relref "20040326-scholarly-works.md" >}})
and
[here]({{<  relref "20040320-testing-maps.md" >}}).

This also reminds me of an article I was reading yesterday by
[Terry
Noel](http://webs.wichita.edu/marketing/Faculty%20Information.htm\#Terry_Noel)
in the [Journal of Management
Education](http://ariel.ingentaselect.com/vl=732628/cl=94/nw=1/rpsv/ij/sage/10525629/v28n2/contp1-1.htm).
In his article _Lessons from the learning classroom_ he describes a
situation which parallels the problems discussed here. I
Now all of this has a direct and immediate relevance to my PhD
study. My topic, in case I haven't mentioned it often enough is
_Strategising in professional service firms_. In particular I'm
using the framework/world view of
[strategy-as-practice](http://www.strategy-as-practice.org/) to explore
strategy making (aka strategising). Part of my problem in that
research is how do I come to understand how strategists think about the
world? What is their functioning knowledge. Again, the content of
what they do, their declarative knowledge, is relatively, straight
forward. But, their functioning knowledge is much more difficult
to grasp. Simply watching them do their work may not reveal the logic
behind it. This is the challenge faced by ethnographers throughout
academe, and this is the challenge faced by students 'watching'
their lecturers.


[^1]: I expect I am as guilty of doing this as anyone. But then again,
    taking in everything from such a lecture is hard work.

[^2]: Psychodrama--sociodrama. I wouldn't worry to much about the
    difference here.
