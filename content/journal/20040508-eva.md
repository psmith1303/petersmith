By luck, one team using [NetMike](https://www.smartsims.com) managed to
catch up with me on Friday. They are sure they will win (at least in
their world) because their [EVA](https://www.sternstewart.com/) is so much
better than the other teams.

I've had a _quick_ look at the numbers (in their world), and I
think they have every reason to be confident. I'm not going to bother
looking at the others--that's not the point. What is interesting
is that someone (their CFO) has brought a really
useful tool to bear on the situation--they know that in the long run
they will win, because they are constantly seeking to improve their
EVA.

Once upon a time, we had teams develop a 
[balanced scorecard](https://www.balancedscorecard.org/), but few teams would develop
measures that would provide them with useful information and that
would guide them into the future. Too often the measures where vague,
and goals unclear. So, it's really pleasing to see a team having a
clear measure of how they are doing, rather than just relying on
simple measures, such as SHV or
capitalisation.
