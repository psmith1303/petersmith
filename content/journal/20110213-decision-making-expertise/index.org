Here are some notes from:

Yates, J. F., & Tschirhart, M. D. (2006). Decision-making expertise. In
K. A. Ericsson, N. Charness, P. J. Feltovich, & R. R. Hoffman (Eds.),
_The Cambridge handbook of expertise and expert performance_.
Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.

Yates has elsewhere defined a decision as "a commitment to a course of
action that is intended to yield results that are satisfying for
specified individuals" (2003, p. 24).

When thinking about expertise in the context of decision-making, there
are a number of ways one might identify _decision quality_.

From the _satisfying-results perspective_, a high quality decision is
one that achieves the intended results. Whereas, there are a number of
argues why such view is unsatisfactory. One argument that I find
compelling, in this regard, is that that decisions are made under
conditions of uncertainty, and therefore any evaluation of a decision
must focus on the stakes and the odds, rather than the outcome. And so,
from the _coherence perspective_, a high quality decision is that is
"logically coherent, inasmuch as it is not self-contradictory.

However, that is easier said than done ... as all kinds of biases may
enter the picture. For example, give a few cases, people may generalise
a rule about those cases, but upon getting new (and contradictory cases)
they will tend to discount/ignore the new cases. Given that decisions
are often a social construction, and as a result people often conflate
subject matter expertise with decision-making expertise.

A different approach is that offered by the _process-decomposition
perspective_. In this perspective the overall process of decision-making
is 'decomposed' into individual elements. The argument being that, if
all the elements are executed well the decision-making is likely to be
good. Although t is hard to know how to effectively split decisions into
elements, research in many fields have arrived at what is called the
_cardinal decision issue perspective_. It looks something like:

#### A big picture of the cardinal decision issue perspective (Yates & Tschirhart, 2006)

Such an approach, as shown in the figure above, is often used in
root-cause analysis.
