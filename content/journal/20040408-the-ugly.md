I subscribe to the the [JIS Plagiarism
mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/PLAGIARIS.html) and a couple of interesting
articles can be found there.

In the first [The Journal of E-Learning](https://www.ejel.org) has an
article called [Plagiarism and Poor Academic Practice? A Threat
to the Extension of e-Learning in Higher
Education](https://www.ejel.org/volume-2/vol2-issue1/issue1-art25.htm)
which provides some interesting facts on the size of the problem.

According to the article, in the UK:

> ... Franklyn-Stokes and Newstead (1995) and Newstead et.al. (1996)
> have attempted to ascertain the frequencies of a range of
> non-academic practices. Students were asked to report whether they had
> engaged in a range of behaviour at least once in the previous
> academic year.

And their table looked like this (allowing for translation between mediums)
table.


| Behaviour| Percentage reporting behaviour| 
|-------|--------------------:| 
| Paraphrasing material from another source without acknowledging
the author|  54| 
| Inventing data|  48| 
| Allowing coursework to be copied by another student|  46| 
| Copying material for coursework from a book or other publication
without acknowledging the source|  42| 
| Copying another student's coursework with their knowledge|  36| 
| Doing another student?s coursework for them|  16| 
| Copying from a neighbour during an exam without them realising| 13| 


Anyway it makes interesting reading. Another thing that is
interesting to read is the [The Plagiarism
Blog](https://tass-plagiarism.blogspot.com/). For example, one of the
[stories](https://www.canada.com/calgary/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id49ee48c-7aae-4551-9cc9-7ad274743c4c) 
on the Blog talks about a Canadian university that has given up using
take home essays as a form of assessment as an means to counter, what
they see, as increased plagiarism.

I watch with curiosity what will happen.
