Last year, I attended a practice workshop at the [University of
Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au/). Afterwards, there was an interesting
presentation by [Paula
Jarzbakowski](https://web.archive.org/web/20130326112217/http://www1.aston.ac.uk/aston-business-school/staff/academic/esg/prof-paula-jarzabkowski/)"
called "Towards a theory of coordinating: Creating coordinating
mechanisms in practice". At the end of the presentation, I was left
wondering what these coordinating mechanisms add to our existing
understanding--do they really go beyond what Lewin (1994) said.

Paula's on-the-spot response was that Lewin's model was static, inasmuch
as it presupposed there were stable conditions (for the unfreezing,
moving, re-freezing to occur). In other words, her contention was that
Lewin's model didn't handle continuous change well--in modern life there
are no periods of stability. However, I seem to recall that Lewin's
model assumed _quasi-stable_ conditions, and not actual stability.

It then occurred to me that many (most) people have not read Lewin in
the original; they rely on others interpretations. Over the years, this
may have resulted in a overly simplistic understand of Lewin and his
work. It also reminded me that it had been a long time since I read
Lewin myself. So, I thought I should briefly revisit his work.

My starting point turned out to be a Manford Kuhn's (1951) review of a
collection of Lewin's works. Kuhn argues three things.

1. Field theory has not advanced much since it was first articulated in
the 1930s (recall, the review was done in 1951).
2. Many of the concepts from field theory have counterparts in symbolic
interactionism (_i.e_., the social). However, it is not the case
that all of symbolic interactionism can be readily translated into
field theory.
3. There has been considerable more impact by field theory on the
consideration of the individual (_e.g._, the psychological).

Overall, Kuhn seems to argue that Lewin and his field theory can span
both the micro (individualist) and macro (societist) approaches in the
creation of a "general school of social psychology" (p.147).

And now I need to re-read Lewin's work ...
