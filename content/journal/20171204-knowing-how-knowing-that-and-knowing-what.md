_Episteme_, for the Greeks, "meant something not quite identical to
our 'knowledge' .... episteme could mean both knowledge and skill,
know that and knowing how." (p. 31). In this way it is close to the
work _techne_ that did mean 'skill'. In the verbal form, _epistamai_
it means "knowing how to do something" (p. 31).


"_Episteme_ did not exclude practical skill. However, not any human
ability, not any manual dexterity could be called _episteme_. Many of
them were referred to by the much less honorific title of _empeirira_"
(p. 35).
