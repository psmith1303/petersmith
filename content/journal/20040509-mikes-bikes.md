It seem's that [Simulation &
Gaming](http://www.unice.fr/sg/) are finally going to publish, in June,
the two reviews that [Doug Carrie](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/dcarrie) 
and I wrote about
[Mike's Bikes](http://www.smartsims.com). Well, that's a relief--we
wrote those well over two years ago.

I've used several business simulations over the years, and I do
like Mike's Bikes. However, there are plenty of other good choices out
there--such as [Marketplace](http://www.marketplace-simulation.com/), or
the good work of the folks at [Strategy
Dynamics](http://www.strategydynamics.com/). They all have their pros and
cons--it really depends what you want to do.

For MGMT 301, Mike's Bikes is a good choice
because of the richness of the data. Students from most business
disciplines can find something familiar to work with, and yet few
students really get to grasp all the intricacies (and when they do,
it feels like SmartSims seems to higher them).
