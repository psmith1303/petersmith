I've been having a quick look through the essays that have been
submitted for the recent assignment. So far, only one person has
mentioned the content of their journals (as opposed to saying that
they were doing a journal).

_How strange_. I wonder why people haven't drawn on that resource?
In many ways the journals should have been the data and evidence for
the assignment.

I've just finished reading a really good assignment that is well
linked to _Mornington Crescent_. I've asked the author if I can
circulate it. It has a few flaws, but it the best I've read so far.
(And, it has a link to a good
[site](http://madeira.physiol.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/delphi/interactive/mcg/mcgames.pl)
too.)
