has been talking about the economics of textbooks, and how the money is
distributed. He reports that:

> 1. Five conglomerates control 80% of textbook production.
> 2. They sell their product to distributors/retailers, who in turn
> sell them to bookstores (on and off campus, including internet).
> 3. Four wholesalers dominate textbook distribution, especially used > books.
> 4. These four wholesalers operate about 1/3 of college bookstores.
> About 1/2 are university owned and operated, and the remaining 15%
> are independents.
> 5. If a new book costs $100, wholesalers typically buy it back for
> $15 to $25 and resell it for $50.

I knew that the retailers mark-up was about 100% (that is, from $50 to
$100), but I was surprised at how much the wholesaler makes (from $15
to $50, that's over 300%. I doubt that the situation is that much
different here in New Zealand.
