In an earlier
[entry]({{< relref "20040525-still-doing-maps-and-incidents.md" >}})
I wrote (complete with typo--_out_ should be _our_):

Which seems all well and good. But, I'm reading an assignment and I
find:

> Maps can be used to filter out perceptions of the real world,
they can bring some things into sharp relief and they can diminish the
importance of other things.
