The course, _MGMT 301: Management Theory & Practice_ is a course at Stage II (that's
typically, or ideally, in a student's final year at the
[University](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) (if they are doing a major or
similar in
[management](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100505010923/https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz:80/).

The course is based around the use of [Mike's Bikes
(advanced)](https://www.smartsims.com) and seeks to help students
reflect on their practice as managers as they work in teams running a
simulated bicycle company, and as they compete with other student
run companies.
