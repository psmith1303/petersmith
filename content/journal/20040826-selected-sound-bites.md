A few Porterian quotes taken from:

Harfield, T. (1997). Strategic management and Michael Porter: A
postmodern reading. _Electronic Journal of Radical
Oranizational Theory, 4_(1).
 


> Competitive advantage is hardly a new subject.... marketing,
production, control, finance, and many other activities in a firm
have a role in competitive advantage. ... Competitive advantage
cannot be truly understood without combining all these disciplines
into a holistic view of the entire firm.


> In practice, a firm must understand where each of its
competitors falls on the spectrum from good to bad and behave
accordingly. A good competitor understands and plays by the rules of
competition in an industry, and can recognize and read market signals.
Some bad competitors will never become good competitors. A firm
must be prepared to fight battles in order to convert bad
competitors into good ones. For example, a foreign competitor
entering what it perceives to be a strategic market is usually a
bad competitor. Its stakes are too high, and it may also not
understand the rules of the game.
> 
> These considerations suggest that a firm must continually work
to manage its competitors' expectations and assumptions.


> Competitive strategy is about being different.


> ... a firm can achieve and sustain overall cost leadership, then
it will be an above-average performer in its industry provided it can
command prices at or near the industry average. A firm that can
achieve and sustain differentiation will be an above-average
performer in its industry if its price premium exceeds the extra costs
incurred in being unique.


> A firm that is stuck in the middle will earn attractive profits
only if the structure of its industry is highly favourable, or if the
firm is fortunate enough to have competitors that are also stuck in
the middle. Becoming stuck in the middle also affects successful
firms, who compromise their generic strategy for the sake of growth
or prestige.


> If a firm can achieve cost leadership and differentiation
simultaneously, the rewards are great because the benefits are
additive--differentiation leads to premium prices at the same time that
cost leadership implies lower costs.

So, I wonder, what is your firm doing? How would you describe its
strategy?
