Sometimes, one is asked to teach a new course. In such a
circumstance, what is one to do. Judging by the various listservs,
e.g. [Management
Education](http://aomlists.pace.edu/archives/MG-ED-DV.html), the most
popular thing to do is to see what others are doing when they have to
teach that type of course.

Now finding that information got a little bit easier
with [Dan Cohen's](http://www.dancohen.org/) very clever
[Syllabus Finder](https://web.archive.org/web/20090422144508/http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/syllabi/).

Dan's also a leading light in the [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/)
project that adds a citation/bibliography engine to
[FireFox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/).
