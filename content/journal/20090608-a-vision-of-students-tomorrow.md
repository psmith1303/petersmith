It's hard to believe that its been over two months since my post on
[A vision of students today]({{< relref "20090403-a-vision-of-students.md" >}}).
Well I have been somewhat preoccupied with my thesis. Anyway, today I read
[Revisiting 'A Vision of Students Today'](https://web.archive.org/web/20090217151640/http://mediatedcultures.net/ksudigg/?p=188) by
[Michael Wesch](https://web.archive.org/web/20080913062647/http://mediatedcultures.net/about.htm).
It has re-invigorated me. I'm started to finalise my teaching outlines
for MGMT 716, INTBUS 202, and BUSADMIN 768, and as I do so I am keen
not to fall into the trap of making those classes high-tech
information-dumps.

No. What I hope to do is to help the students in my class to develop
better judgement in the topics I am teaching (Extending software
engineering, Foundations of strategy, and Strategic Management).
In a practical sense, that means I have to find ways to connect those
topics to real world concerns for the students. Only then, can I (and
they) hope to break out of the "getting by" game can pervade
students' experiences of University.

\[Of course, there are big links here to my research topics, and in
particular the notion of communities of practice\]

I think for MGMT 716, Extending software
engineering, the current structure of course will pretty much
achieve those goals. Having students help real firms apply the
[Cambridge 'fast start' technology road mapping
model](http://www.iamot.org/paperarchive/GSTBB.PDF), whilst working
with senior management should be a recipe for success. Of course the
devil is in the detail.

For INTBUS 202, Foundations of strategy, the
move to [Team-based learning](https://web.archive.org/web/20100901055818/http://teambasedlearning.apsc.ubc.ca/)
has the potential to succeed in those goals. But, I need to spend a
week or two sorting out the detailed structure--otherwise I'm likely to
meet my first goal but not the second.

Probably, the biggest challenge (for me) is BUSADMIN 768. Traditionally, 
I would do this as a pure case course. However, I need to spend time 
considering how I connect it to the students real-world concerns. This 
is a similar problem to that with INTBUS 202--event though
the teaching methodology is different (TB vs. case-based teaching). 
Perhaps I should consider using TBL in both classes.
