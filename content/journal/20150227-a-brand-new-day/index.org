Well it is a new semester anyway; the weekend before the start of semester 1 of
2015, and I am putting together the final touches to the course. I think it has
started well with the kick-off video that I emailed to students this week. I
hope it gets them excited and motiRecoveryvated ahead of the first class. On Monday, I
will send it out to any newcomers to the class.

I plan to do three things this weekend. First, I need to write some practice
quiz questions. I am planning to use a combination of QuestionMark and my
scanning software--but I am wondering if I should use QuestionMark as there
will be a new LMS next year. Second, I am going to write a new teaching note on
how to take a position on a case--the challenge there is to keep it to a size
that is useful without it becoming a book. Finally, I shall revisit my Week 1
slide-deck. They are the only slides I really use in the whole of the course
and I want to incorporate the takeaways I got from last year when I did it (each
year, I think the deck improves).


Also on Monday, I will print out the name cards for each member of the class.
It makes life so much easier when I can use everyone's name.
