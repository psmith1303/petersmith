For the past three days, I have been participating in a workshop on Survey Design. 
It was all very interesting and helpful. And there was one topic that we did that 
I think could be useful in BUSINESS 304. The facilitator talk a lot about how, in 
many ways, a survey is a conversation between the respondent and the survey. 
To that end, she talked about Grice and his maxims of conversation. These are 
rules that we typically--albeit unconsciously--adhere to during a conversation.

Here is a brief summary from [Han's Communication Theory blog](http://hancommtheory.blogspot.co.nz/2012/04/grices-maxim.html):

> In daily life a person unconsciously communicates with others in many ways
> such as language, gestures and expressions. In communication he/she is
> expected to give or share information with others. In order to make a
> conversation understood by the speaker and the hearer, there must be the
> general principle of language use, which is called the cooperative principle
> (Renkema, 1993: 9). The principle states that the speaker gives contribution
> in conversation in which the speaker is engaged. This cooperative principle
> contains four categories, which are formulated as basic rules or maxims.
> "Maxim is a set of norms which language users adhere to in order to uphold
> the effectiveness and efficiency of communication" (Hatim and Mason, 1990:
> 242). Those four maxims are maxim of quantity, maxim of quality, maxim of
> relevance, and maxim of manner.

> **Maxim of quantity** demands the speaker's contribution informative as is
> required and no more informative than is required. Below are the examples of
> an utterance that obeys the maxim of quantity and one that violates the
> maxim!  

> Example of obeying: 

> A: "Where are you going?"  

> B: "I'm going to the post office."  

> In the example, B gives comments to A's statement without adding other
> information .

> Example of disobeying / violation: 

> A: "Are you going to work tomorrow?"  

> B: "I am on jury duty, but I'll have to go to the doctor in the evening. I
> have asked the manager for permission."  

> In this example, B's reply violates maxim of quantity because B does not give
> information as required by A, i.e. yes or no. Instead, B gives more
> information which is not required or expected at all.

> **Maxim of quality** requires the speaker not to say what is believed to be
> false and for which the speaker lacks adequate evidence. Below are the
> examples of the utterance that obeys the maxim of quality and that one
> violates the maxim!  

> Example of obeying: 

> A: "Why did you come late last night?"

>  B: "The car was broken down."

> In the example, B gives the truth that his car was broken down so that he
> came late.  

> Example of disobeying / violation: 

> A: "The Teheran's in Turkey, isn't teacher?"

> B: "And London's in America I suppose."

> In the example, B's reply is supposed to suggest that A is incorrect and B
> violates the maxim of quality.

> **Maxim of relevance** required the speaker to be relevant. Below are the
> examples of utterance that obeys the maxim of relevance and that one violates
> the maxim!  

> Example of obeying: 

> A: "Where is my box of chocolates?"  

> B: "It is in your room."  

> In the example, B's reply relates to the question, not talking about
> something else. 

> Example of disobeying / violation 

> A: "Where's my box of chocolates?"

> B: "I don't know mine either."  

> In the example B's answer is not relevant to A's question. B says something
> else which is not about A's problem at all.
> 
> 
> **Maxim of Manner** requires the speaker to avoid obscurity of expression and
> ambiguity. Maxim of manner demands the speaker to be brief and orderly. Below
> are the examples of utterance that obeys the maxim of manner and that one
> violates the maxim!  

> Example of obeying: 

> A: "Where was Alfred yesterday?"

> B: "Alfred went to the store and bought some whiskey."

> In the example, B's answer obeys the manner maxim: be orderly, because she
> gives a clear explanation where A was.  

> Example of disobeying / violation: 

> A: "Why was he arrested?"

> B: "He stole the money from the bank."

>  In the example B's statement is ambiguous.  It can be interpreted that B
>  didn't steal the money which is stored in he bank. He had gone the bank
>  first and he stole the money in another place.  Another interpretation is
>  that he stole the money stored in the bank. He got the money by robbing the
>  bank.

> Lavinson (1983:103) stated that Grice's maxims above specify what
> participants have to do in order to converse in a maximally efficient,
> rational, cooperative way: the participant should speak sincerely,
> relevantly, and clearly while providing sufficient information.

Overall, I think when students are taking part in a case discussion, they should seek to adhere to these norms of quantity, quality, relevance, and manner. I'll make some notes on this and talk to the class about them.
