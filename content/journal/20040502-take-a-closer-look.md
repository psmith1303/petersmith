I was reading [Amit's weekly journal
entry](https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/archives/000323.html)
today and I was struck by the change that seems to be happening in
that team. In general terms, I think we (DPE)
have noticed such changes in the past in other teams. I know I'm
reading a lot into a relatively brief journal entry, but it does
sound like a significant change has/is occurring.

_But why do such changes come about?_

There are many candidates when looking for theoretical
explanations. Is it a case of the team moving from one stage of group
development to another (as per Tuckman &
Jensen)? Is it the team seeking a leadership change (according to
Bion)? Are we half way 'there' a la Gersick and punctuated
equilibrium? And those are just the first few theories to spring to
mind; there are many more (e.g an ecological model of variation and
adaptation).

But, we've never really nailed down what is the most useful
explanation for the 'typical' revolutionary change we seen in MGMT 
301 teams. Alas, we rarely get enough feedback
to make a solid diagnosis. If anyone is going to 'hit the nail on the
head', it is going to be someone in one of the teams--someone who is
close enough to the action to see what is actually happening and
knowledgeable enough to match that rich description to the 'right'
theory.

Perhaps some people will take this to be a foreshadowing of the
final assignment--but, it isn't intended to be that. I'm just
curious to understand the teams more fully.

BTW, for those who are interested, I read a pretty solid [lit
review](https://www.loyno.edu/\~dmyers/S04_classes/S04_CMMN702/temp_examples/www.stedwards.edu_science_last_Literature_Review.rtf)
on Virtual Teams this morning. If you're interested in virtual
teams, then it presents an interesting summary of some of the
literature.
