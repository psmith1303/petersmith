I'm a little old fashioned. Aside from keeping up with things using
RSS, I also subscribe to a number of mailing lists. One of them 
mentioned a book, namely:

> Clawson, J. G., & Haskins, M. E. (2006).
> _Teaching management: A field guide for professors, corporate
> trainers and consultants_. Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press.

_What a great read_. This has to be one of the best (and most
practical) books on teaching I have read. There will be a lot I take
back to teaching (when I get back into the classroom in 2008).
