One of the students in BUSINESS 101 noticed that in a reference such as
(Oram, 2007; 2011) I was using colons, instead of commas. They said it
should be (Oram, 2007, 2011). I was away from the office (without a copy
of the Publication manual of the APA to hand), and I said it might just
be a difference between the 5th and 6th editions. Being a long-time user
of Zotero (and before that Endnote), I have stopped worrying about how my
citations look. I take it for granted that they are correct.

_I was wrong._ It should have been (Oram, 2007, 2011).

As a result, [I have reported
it](http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/17356/semicolions-in-apa-6th) to
the good folk at [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/). They say it should be
fixed in the next day or two. I'll refresh my styles next week and see
what happens.

So, thanks to the student (whose name I no longer have) for pointing
that out.
