The final step in much (most/all) research is writing up the research
for some sort of publication. For me, this usually means writing a
journal article or a conference paper. I have
noted
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20091213-research-as-a-second-language.md" >}}) about
the power of the forty-paragraphs structure in putting together a
journal article. But there is much more to getting ones work
published.

So, I was delighted to
find [Charlotte Cloutier's](https://projectscrib.org/bios/) excellent
site [Project Scribe](https://projectscrib.org/).

There are a raft of resources here; mainly interviews with editors,
authors, and reviewers in the academic world of 'organizational
studies'. In doing so, it meets Charlotte's aspirations for the site:

> Writing academic articles can be quite hard work, and academia,
> especially for those starting out, can be quite the lonely place. I
> see my personal investment in this blog as a means of trying to
> overcome a bit of that: to give you tips, ideas and inspiration to
> help you along when the going gets tough, and to share what others
> have experienced, so that we can all learn from it.

Thanks Charlotte (and your collaborators) for a great (and ongoing)
resource.
