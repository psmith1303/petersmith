I had a really good class in MGMT 101 this morning, they were animated
and talkative (in a good way). I wonder how much that was a
consequence of having them all sit together at the front of the class.

[Marie Wilson](https://web.archive.org/web/20080226045120/http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/mwilson) once
reminded me of the difference that occurs in class dynamics as a
result of how spread out the students are.

Anyway, one of the things that I don't think I made clear today, was
the relationship between the Trait Approach to leadership and the
music I was playing (O Superman--see below for the details).

In a glib way, the trait approach presupposes that one either has, or
doesn't have, the necessary characteristics to be a great (or
heroic) leader. Alas, there are so many organisations and so few
'heroic' leaders--that is to say, from the trait approach, perhaps
the world doesn't have enough supermen/superwomen.

Actually, it is interesting to compare and contrast the Trait
Approach to leadership with Jim Collins' ideas of Level 5
leadership. Although the traits are different between the two, one
is still left wondering where these 'heroes' are going to come from.
