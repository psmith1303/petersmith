I was reading [Media
Tinker](http://www.mediatinker.com/blog/archives/008326.html) when I came
across the quote _A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little
minds_ by Ralph Waldo Emerson. A quick trip to
[Bartleby](http://www.bartleby.com/59/3/foolishconsi.html) confirmed its
providence as coming from his 1841 essay
[Self-reliance](http://www.farid-hajji.net/books/en/Emerson_Ralph_Waldo/es1-selfreliance.html).

It would be easy to make some half-baked link from this quotation to
the topic for next week's class on *single and double loop learning*.
But, his essay is neither short, nor a straightforward; and such a
link would do little credit to me (and no credit to Emerson). Taking
these few words out of their complete context is a naive thing to do.
I seem to recall [Barbara
Czarniawska](http://www.handels.gu.se/gri/gribcza.html) (who likes to
link management and
[literature](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASI/0198296142)) 
once saying that a good way to
study management is through great novels and stories. I'm not an
aficionado of Emerson--he wasn't on my reading list at school--but
what I do know about him makes me think that Barbara would be happy to
engage with his work.

Thus, I think it would be really interesting for someone to weave the
Emerson essay and the issues that will be presented in next week's
class (and indeed throughout the whole course) together.
