On the [JISC
Plagiarism](https://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/) mailing list, I came across an
[interesting article](https://www.slate.com/id/2157435/) at
[Slate](https://www.slate.com/) by Meghan O'Rourke.

Not wishing to step on anyone's copyright, I haven't reproduced the
article here; rather here is a quote from the opening of the article
to get you interested enough to visit Slate.

> We may know pornography when we see it, but the same can't be said
> of plagiarism. Ever since it was revealed last month that several
> passages in Ian McEwan's Atonement closely resemble sections of
> Lucilla Andrews' World War I memoir, No
> Time For Romance, critics have debated whether the similarities
> constitute wholesale "plagiarism" or mere literary
> "discourtesy." The one thing everyone does agree on, apparently,

> and Alan Dershowitz. In an op-ed in early 2003, Condoleezza Rice

Anyway, the [article](https://www.slate.com/id/2157435/) is a good 
read--I commend it to you.
