There have been a number of questions about the up coming
assignment and especially about _critical incidents_. So, what is
a critical incident. Well it isn't what common sense might tell you.

[Paul A.  Twelker](https://www.tiu.edu/psychology/Twelker/critical_incident_technique.htm)
has a pretty good definition of a critical incident:

> An "incident" is best thought as "any observable human activity
that is sufficiently complete in itself to permit inferences and
predictions to be made about the person performing the act." In
order for the incident to be considered "critical," it "must occur
in a situation where the purpose or intent of the act seems fairly
clear to the observer and where its consequences are sufficiently
definite to leave little doubt concerning its effects
[(Flanagan, 1954)](https://www.apa.org/psycinfo/special/cit-article.pdf).

And that's about it. I wouldn't get sidetracked by the
_Critical Incident Technique_ (or it's plethora of uses in medicine).
That's probably not helpful for this assignment--too much of a
distraction.

There are also some questions about maps. Alas, I don't have a
short answer for that one. If you missed the class then you'd best
start with revisiting the readings.
