Every Friday, when teaching MGMT 301, I
check [Net Mike](https://www.smartsims.com) to see if everything is ready
for the roll-over later in the day. If I have time on my hands I also
read the message board that is built into Net Mike.

I wonder what sense an ethnographer would make from the messages
that are left there? What verbs would she or he use to describe the type
of messages? What purpose would he or she ascribe to the messages?
Over the years, I've seen that there are patterns. Overwhelmingly,
the messages are from the males--so far that means _96% of the
messages_! Rarely, do the messages rise above the level of
graffiti.

However, from time to time individuals and teams do something
different, more meaningful (that's a value judgement on my part).
However, the general pattern of content at the team, region, and
world level goes as follows.

- _At the team level_, that is to say those messages that can only
be seen by a single team, the messages to be of the type "Hi", or "Did
we do well", or "Aren't we doing badly".
- _At the region level_, e.g. only the teams in Auckland can see
the message, or only the teams in Napier can see them, the
messages seem to be loaded with bravado "Don't mess with us", is a
frequent statement.
- _At the world level,_ which everyone cans see, the messages are
quite aggressive with calls for companies to get together and "take
_so and so_ down".

I wonder what drives this. Is it escalating commitment of some
type? Testosterone? Or is it as simple as a need to leave a mark
saying "We were-here".
