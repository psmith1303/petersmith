Over on [Study Hacks](https://calnewport.com/) there is an article on
[How to Build a Paper Research
Database](https://calnewport.com/blog/?p=121). The article describes:

> This is how you win a Pulitzer Prize. Imagine, then, what this
> technique would do for an undergraduate research paper or your
> senior honors thesis. In this article, I'm going to teach you how to
> build a simplified Branch-style Paper Research Database using
> Microsoft Excel. I'll tell you how to format it, populate it, and
> use it to structure your writing.

It seems to me that just by using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
would do much (if not all) of what the article recommends. Not only
that, Zotero would do it more easily and quickly.
