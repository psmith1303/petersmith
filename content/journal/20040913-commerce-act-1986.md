Of course for all the details one should read the whole Act, which is
available at
the
[Public Access to Legislation](http://web-beta.archive.org/web/20040402021826/http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/pal/) project.
Perhaps one of the most interesting sections is S.80 which discusses
the pecuniary penalty, and S.82 which discusses, finally,

> _98.Commission may require person to supply information or
