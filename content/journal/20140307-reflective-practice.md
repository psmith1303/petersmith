I have two thoughts ahead of the first session of the course ACADPRAC 701. 

First, is a question about the starting point of the course;
reflective practice. It seems odd to start with what we--teachers, for
want of a better word--do, rather that what the students do; i.e.,
learning. As Sotto (2010) says, "deciding how to teach without first
studying how people learn is like giving an answer before one has heard
the question". Yes, reflection is a powerful mechanism for fostering
ones own learning. So, I wonder if we are intended to 'come to'
learning and what it is in our own way.

My second observation is on part of the description of this weeks
seminar:

> This session will explore conceptions of teaching as a "reflective
> practice" that benefits from repeated cycles of self-scrutiny,
> evaluation and change

Messers Argyris and Sch&ouml;n have given us many fine ideas including that
of theory-of-action and theory-in-use. The former relates to what we
think we do, the later is what others actually see us doing; and these
may/are often different from one another. I might say that I like
working in teams and value what they can achieve, but others may well
observe that I am rather introverted and often seem to be happier and
more productive when working alone.

The [Joahri window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) is
interesting in that regard. but neither really tell the complete story.

As something of an aside, the earliest reference I can find to the
Johari Window (through Google n-gram view) is in 1960 and
the *Baltimore Bulletin of Education*. It notes that the Johari 
Windows was named after Joe Luft and Harry Ingham back in 1955. 
Sixty years on, I wonder why we do not have a better model/framework. 
Anyway, if it is really that robust, I'd like to read the 
original--so I have asked the library for a copy.
