As part of _Business policy & strategy_, students have to write a small
(guided) analysis of CZJ. This example is by Pene Geard.

Whilst I haven't finished reading all the cases yet, this is the best
so far. Well done Pene. I hope others can learn from your work (and
thanks for letting me post your essay here). N. Any problems with the 
formatting are entirely mine.

> ### Introduction
> The future is shaped by the past. Before we can begin to consider what
> changes we will implement in the future, we must first understand the
> changes that have lead us to our current position. In particular,
> this essay investigates the changes experienced by the company Carl
> Zeiss Jena as set out in the case "Carl Zeiss Jena: Managing
> Catastrophe." (Kets de Vries & Cannizzo,
> 1998) and the future of Jenoptik, one of the surviving parts of Carl
> Zeiss Jena now under the leadership of Dr. Dierolf. Through this
> investigation I hope to uncover what further strategic changes I
> would recommend Dierolf implement at Jenoptik.
> 
> ###Stagnation
> Let us first consider the structure of CZJ as they approached this unstable period
> of 1989--1991. Wolfgang Biermann, the general manager of CZJ during 1975--1989, had
> an autocratic leadership style causing the organisation to be
> highly centralised and high in formalisation. Additionally, the
> Kombinat developed under the communist regime meant the
> organisation was incredibly complex. These three dimensions high
> centralisation, high formalisation and high
> complexity--indicate the bureaucratic nature of CZJ (Robbins &
> Barnwell, 2002, p. 127).
> 
> "Bureaucracies have a well-deserved reputation for being slow to
> change" (Robbins & Barnwell, 2002, p. 312).
> However, in the political environment of the time change was not
> particularly desirable. Stability was encouraged through "the
> system of state-directed subsidies, prescribed prices, rigid
> production schedules and pre-determined 'revenue surpluses'" (Kets
> de Vries & Cannizzo, 1998, p999). Given the
> political and economic system CZJ's bureaucratic structure was
> appropriate as "bureaucracy is most efficient when matched with
> large size [and] a stable environment" (Robbins & Barnwell, 2002, p.116).
> 
> As the communist economy started to fall apart, however, the
> pressures for change began to grow. But despite the fact that some
> members of management had been pushing for change since the mid 80s,
> Biermann remained in place as a significant barrier to change until
> he withdrew from the operational side of the business and
> eventually left the organisation in December 1989.
> 
> ###Preparation
> At the same time resistance to change within the organisation began
> to decrease once the GD border opened and employees were able
> to visit the west. Most people attributed the relative luxury they
> experienced there to the market economy (Kets de Vries 
> & Cannizzo, 1998, p1002) so looked forward to the
> changes that they believed would allow them to enjoy the same
> luxuries. The opportunity to rejoin the Carl Zeiss Foundation was
> another factor that likely made the coming changes seem more
> attractive.
> 
> At this point a market economy had not yet been introduced so the
> forces for change, though easily identifiable, were still
> relatively weak. According to Strebel (1998), with the organisation
> relatively open to change, the required approach to strategic change
> was cascading implementation. Cascading implementation
> involves "progressive adaptation to change forces [motivated by]
> participative commitment" (Strebel, 1998, p. 312).
> 
> This change path was partially supported by Gattnar's attempts to
> decentralise. However, the effectiveness of these attempts was
> hindered by high absenteeism. Unrealistic expectations and limited
> understanding of the market economy, combined with an
> over-confidence in CZJ's ability to succeed in its current
> form also acted as a barrier to effective change.
> 
> This lack of effective change meant CZJ was caught unprepared by the economic
> and monetary union on 1st July 1990. The forces for change were now
> full throttle and unable to be reversed and CZJ's long term difficulties meant the
> organisation had little time available to make the adaptation.
> According to Strebel (1998), the new approach to change required was
> restructuring.
> 
> ###Reorganisation
> The development of a restructuring plan was begun but during this
> time resistance to change within the organisation was also
> developing. First, they refused the consultants recommendation to
> close down the Analytical Instruments part of the organisation
> demonstrating an emotional attachment to the current
> organisational structure. Additionally, the realisation of how
> many jobs were on the line and the lack of regular, consistent and
> clear information built up fear for the future which translated into
> a resistance to change.
> 
> At the same time CZJ's worsening financial situation, the
> introduction of the D-Mark and the subsequent collapse of the
> eastern markets meant the pressure for change was ever-increasing.
> The restructuring process needed to have been completed more quickly
> in order to meet these change forces while they were manageable, to
> minimise the resistance to the restructuring at the time of
> implementation and to maximise the chances of the restructuring
> process being carried out successfully.
> 
> Speed in the restructuring process could have been aided by bringing
> in new management sooner. Gattnar and his management team were
> highly attached to both the people and the current organisational
> structure so it is understandable that they would have resisted and
> slowed down the process. Yet the consultants on their own did not
> have the authority to move the restructuring plan through to
> implementation. New top management could have provided the firm
> leadership and control that the organisation had been lacking ever
> since Gattnar replaced Biermann. If this firm leadership was provided
> in a form more akin to management-by-objectives rather than the
> centralisation of bureaucracy it could have helped the
> organisation become more adaptable to change.
> 
> Dierolf did provide this firm leadership once he arrived on the scene
> in May 1991, however, in my opinion he was less effective than he
> could have been if brought in earlier. It is also unfortunate that the
> management team from Oberkochen were not brought in at the same time
> as it seems Dierolf was unable to complete the restructuring without
> their assent on the division of assets.
> 
> With the restructuring process finally completed along with the
> separation into two legal entities, Dierolf is left in charge of the
> new Jenoptik and its future direction.
> 
> ###Evolution
> The forces for change are still strong and irreversible but now the
> restructuring and new ownership has bought the organisation some
> time. Following Strebel (1998) the advised change path now is
> revitalisation. Revitalisation involves "ongoing change throughout
> the organisation [through] slow continuous adaptation" (Strebel,
> 1998, p. 303). De Wit and Meyer (1998) refer to this kind of change,
> with its broad scope yet relatively low amplitude of change, as
> comprehensive moderate change. This kind of change is similar to
> revolutionary change in terms of scope but differs in the amplitude
> of change. (De Wit & Meyer, 1998, p. 245).
> 
> At this point I believe that due to their previous negative
> experiences of revolutionary change, the employees of Jenoptik
> would be more responsive to change with low amplitude. This is
> important because the success of any change within an organisation
> often relies on the support of its member. However, by implementing
> a more continuous form of change CZJ should be able to avoid the need for
> revolutionary change any time in the near future while still allowing
> it to adapt to its new environment. The current unstable and fluid
> state of the organisation means they are also more open to the
> implementation of continuous change than they have been
> previously.
> 
> ###Operation
> The revolutionary change so far has also been quite disruptive to
> the operations side of the business, exacerbating the
> organisations negative financial situation. If the organisation
> is to move forward, operations need to be gotten under control. It
> would have been ideal to have someone overseeing operations right
> from the start. That is, while SpÃ¤th was responsible for investor
> recruitment and Dierolf organising the restructuring process,
> someone should have been responsible for keeping operations running
> as smoothly as possible given the circumstances.
> 
> However, with the restructuring process complete, Dierolf is now
> available to take on this role. His first task should be the
> consolidation of the new structure and ensuring that this
> structure enables operational effectiveness. Then, Dierolf must
> motivate employees to work towards making the organisation as
> efficient as possible and able to not only survive, but also
> prosper.
> 
> One way to do this would be to develop a challenging objective that
> the whole organisation can unite under and strive to accomplish,
> similar to Dr. Ernst Thomke achieved for Swatch in the 1980s (Ullmann,
> 1998). If this objective, or vision, was linked to the tradition of
> Carl Zeiss or Ernst Abbe and CZJ's reputation for quality I feel
> employees would be particularly receptive.
> 
> To support this vision Jenoptik should look at adopting some of the
> Carl Zeiss Foundation's statute, especially the social welfare
> policies, despite the fact that this part of the organisation no
> longer as any formal ties to the foundation. This would signal to
> employees that the organisation is still committed to CZJ's traditional values and help to mend their
> currently low morale. It would also help to recover the organisation's
> culture of a commitment to high quality and technological
> advancement. Even if the organisation is not currently in a
> financial position to offer the social welfare benefits of the
> foundation it should develop an implementation timeline regarding
> when these benefits may be feasible, and communicate to employees
> it's intentions to provide these benefits in the future.
> 
> ###Communication
> Communication between top management and employees will be a
> huge factor in the future success of Jenoptik and could probably go
> a long way in curing the mistrust that employees currently feel for
> top management. This emphasises the importance of reintroducing
> the in-house magazine and ensuring that it is published regularly,
> providing comprehensive information for employees on the state of
> the organisation. The magazine could also be used to support the
> organisation's new vision by providing praise for those who have made
> significant contributions to the achievement of the vision.
> 
> ###Capitalisation
> The problem with the reintroduction of the in-house magazine and
> also the implementation of the Carl Zeiss FoundationÃ's social
> welfare policies is that these have the potential to be fairly costly
> and Jenoptik does not have a lot of money to spare at this time. One
> possible way of raising some funds would be to float the company on
> the stock exchange; however I am not sure how well this would fit with
> the organisation's purpose.
> 
> With Jenoptik being state-owned and the majority of its employees
> being provided to investors in the Jena area this indicates that the
> organisation's purpose is to minimise unemployment in Jena. My
> worry is that when companies are publicly listed the shareholder
> perspective of organisational purpose (De Wit & Meyer, 1998) tends 
> to prevail, as shareholder's
> interests are the most obvious and many people support the belief
> "that the fundamental objective of the business corporation is to
> increase the value of its shareholders' investment" (Rappaport,
> 1998, p. 820). This perspective would not support the organisation's
> current purpose. However, to meet their purpose the organisation
> needs to survive so, if the organisation is particularly strapped
> for cash this option may have to be considered anyway, although given
> the current state of the economy it seems unlikely that this option
> would provide much money anyway.
> 
> If this option was chosen the state would have to ensure that this could
> be done without compromising the organisation's purpose. The
> perspective that is required here is the stakeholder perspective
> (Freeman & Reed, 1998) which allows the
> interests of all the parties affected by the organisation's actions to
> be taken into account. However, even under this perspective the
> balance of power often shifts towards the shareholders so if the
> state would have to do something to ensure their power was maintained,
> for example by retaining a majority share in Jenoptik.
> 
> Another way to improve the organisation's financial situation could
> be to move into more attractive markets. At the moment the company's
> core markets are the eastern markets but these are no longer
> trustworthy sources of revenue. It may be that Jenoptik could find
> more fruitful revenue sources in the European, American or Asian
> Pacific markets and because they are no longer using the 'Carl Zeiss'
> name they are not limited by the agreements with Oberkochen over the
> rights to use the name in certain areas. But to research the
> viability of these markets and to have any chance of competing in
> these new markets, Jenoptik needs to develop their marketing
> function just as Oberkochen found they had to in order to compete in a
> market economy.
> 
> The new structure based on product divisions with product
> development, marketing and accounting under the same roof as
> production should support the integration of marketing and
> product development, allowing Jenoptik to quickly develop
> high-quality products that meet customer needs. Further development
> of this capability could allow Jenoptik to both expand
> geographically and enter new businesses in a relatively short
> period of time (Stalk, Evans & Shulman, 1992).
> 
> ###Education
> But how Jenoptik will be able to acquire this capability on their
> limited budget and when they currently have next to no skills in this
> area. The quickest way would be to bring in consultants who could
> perform the necessary tasks and at the same time train Jenoptik's
> employees so that they can eventually take over the role. However,
> this could still be potentially quite costly so other options may have
> to be considered, such as forming some kind of deal with Carl Zeiss
> Oberkochen to learn from their marketing capabilities.
> 
> ###Competition
> Another question is whether this capability will actually lead to
> a sustainable competitive advantage. "A competitive advantage
> is said to be sustainable if it cannot be copied or eroded by the
> actions of rivals, and is not made redundant by environment
> developments" (De Wit & Meyer, 1998, p.
> 338--339). For a capability to provide sustainable competitive
> advantage it needs to be imperfectly imitable (Barney, 1991). There
> is a definite possibility that other companies in the markets
> that Jenoptik hopes to enter are already strong in this capability,
> in which case it will provide Jenoptik with no competitive
> advantage at all. Further research would be required to determine
> whether this was the case. However, even if this capability will not
> provide Jenoptik with a sustainable competitive advantage, if a
> majority of Jenoptik's competitors have this capability it will
> be necessary for Jenoptik to acquire so as not to be at a
> competitive disadvantage.
> 
> ###Conclusion
> Overall, I believe Dierolf needs to focus on evolutionary,
> continuous change to build Jenoptik up to greatness. Due to their
> negative experiences with revolutionary change in the past, I
> doubt he would be able to obtain employee support for more of the
> same.
> 
> Additionally, revolutionary change has the side-effect of
> disrupting the operational side of business and Jenoptik cannot
> afford to have their operations further disrupted. Evolutionary
> change within the organisation can be encouraged through the
> creation of a vision that causes employees to pull together and work
> towards a common goal. If this vision builds upon the values of the
> organisation's founders, Carl Zeiss and Ernst Abbe, at the same time as
> incorporating new concepts in business, such as the importance of
> marketing, Jenoptik has the potential to achieve great success.
