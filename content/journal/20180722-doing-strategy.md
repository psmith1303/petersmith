After class on Friday, I had an email from a student saying, "Just
wanted to give some feedback on the first discussion session and
hopefully get more of an idea of what your looking for." The
sentiments expressed in the email were echoed by a few other students
after class, so I thought it could be useful if I made my reflections
on the email more public (with the student's consent).

I hope that through both these notes and through the progress of the
course, you will see that we were---in fact---discussing strategy. But
that will take some explaining ...

So, is it fair to say, that your focus was on the `what' of strategy. 

Going back to the course outline, it describes strategy has having
three dimensions: strategy process, strategy content, and strategy
context. The 'what' of strategy is about strategy content. My
experience of courses such as BUSINESS 101 and 102, INTBUS 202, and
MKTG 301 is that their emphasis, vis-&agrave;-vis strategy, tends to
be on the 'what' of strategy.

I'm going to drift into some history here, that is not really covered in
the textbook (whereas the three dimensions are), as I find a
historical perspective useful.

The earliest work of strategy, as applied to commerce/business,
emerged in the early 1960s and is associated with people such as
Ansoff and Chandler. They were largely concerned with what the
organization should do; e.g., should the firm engage in related or
unrelated diversification; should the firm be centralised or
decentralised. The questions where about what was the best course of
action for the firm. This was the dominant theme of both research into
and the practice of strategy into the 1970s. In many ways I think this
reached its zenith in the model from Schendel and Hoffer's book
[-@schendel_1979_strategicmanagementnew]:

1. Goal formulation,

2. environmental analysis,

3. Strategy formulation,

4. Strategy evaluation,

5. Strategy implementation, and

6. Strategic control.

Note: Dan Schendel went on to found the Strategic Management Society,
and to publish/edit the Strategic Management Journal; perhaps the most
influential academic resources on strategy.

However, from the 1980s, scholars such as Mintzberg and Pettigrew
became increasingly aware that how strategies came about had as a
profound impact on the organisation/firm. This launched a range of
studies into things such as, how diverse should the top management
team of a firm be to make the 'best' decisions. Thus strategy was seen
having two main threads; content (what) and process (how). To that
mix, the context in which strategy occurs (where) was added; A
bureaucratic organisation and a professional service firm operate
quite differently and they make very different strategies in differing
ways.

Although it would be nice to think that strategy content (what) is
independent of how and where it is made---as Chandler would exemplify
it as structure follows from the strategy of the firm---they are
interconnected. Or as Mintzberg retorted; structure follows strategy
as the left foot follows the right foot (I might have mis-quoted
that).

So, how organizations make strategy, and how members of the class make
strategy, is definitely a topic of strategy.

As an aside, since 1996 and Whittington provocative piece
[@whittington_1996_strategypractice], there has been something of a
recasting of strategy away from 'something that an organisation has',
to 'something people do'. This 'strategy-as-practice' movement has
really taken off in Europe in the last 10 years or so.

And that is what I wanted to happen. But, how you came to your ideas
also matters. Did you come to a good strategy because you had a robust
process, or did you (as some firms do) get their by luck?

I would encourage you, and everyone else, when they feel lost or that
the discussion is going in circles to say so. If you are feeling that
way, I would expect others also feel like that.

That said, how the industry works (strategy context) is important to
know, otherwise ones strategy process (or strategy content) may simply
fail.

You right. And perhaps if more people had a robust analysis we would
have covered more. For example, despite a number of people
saying they had done the 3Cs for Pfizer and Pfizer NZ, few were
willing to but their analysis 'on the table'.

As noted elsewhere, every case is different. At times the class will
focus on strategy process, at other times the focus will be on
strategy content or strategy context. Sometimes we do all three. Then
again, as the course outline notes, they are all interconnected.

What I look for is people to demonstrate robust thinking based on
sound frameworks/models. In other words: To do the work of strategy
and to present that work in the typical context of strategy work in a
manner that others working in the field of strategy will regard as
being competently done.
