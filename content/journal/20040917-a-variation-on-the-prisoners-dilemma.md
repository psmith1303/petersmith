Let us suppose there there exists a small town, which has two bakers.
Currently, the bakers sell their bread for $1:50 per loaf. Both bakers
have been in the business a long time, and their cost structure for
bread is pretty much the same. It costs them $1:00 to produce a loaf.

So, their profit per loaf is 50 cents. Each baker sells the same number
of loaves (800) each day. So, in total, each baker is making $400 in
profit per day.

After doing some (very good) market research, one of the bakers
discovers that dropping the price by 10 cents, will increase sales by
30%. The competitor's sales will decrease by a similar amount. In other
words, if one baker drops the price, they will sell 1040 loaves and by
making a profit of 40 cents each loaf, the baker will get $416 in
profit. Of course, the other baker is now only selling 560 loaves, and
making $280 dollars.

Should both bakers drop their price to $1:40 then there will be no
change in the number of loaves sold by each baker (800), and their
total profit will be $320.

So, should either baker drop the price of bread?

In the original [prisoner's
dilemma](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/) if there
was only one change to sell bread then the 'best' thing either baker can
do is drop their prices. However, if there are likely to be repeated
rounds, then the baker should wait and see if the other baker drops
their price.

Of course the problem becomes more complex when there are more bakers
in the town--with many bakers, breaking ranks can lead to the
classical economics situation of the "tragedy of the commons".
But, I feel, that at the heart of these type of situations is the
issue of trust. Can we trust our competitor to do the right thing?  And
yet... and yet classical market theory seems to be based on people
acting in their own (self) interest.

As an aside, has anyone tried the [100 prisoner's
problem](http://www.algonet.se/\~ug/projects/lightbulb/)? I'm surprised
this hasn't shown up in BCG interviews yet (or has it?).
