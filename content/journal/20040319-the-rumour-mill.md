It's been a busy week. [John
Gray](http://www.aegis.uws.edu.au/Staff/TEXT/John%20Gray.htm) has been
visiting from Australia as we are working on a research project
together. Because of this, I've also spent some time with an 
RA (Research Assistant) who is working on the project with me. 
As, it happens she is an alumnus of MGMT 301. Somewhat unexpectedly, she raised the
question of "Would the simulation be reset after the practice
roll-overs, or would it just carry on?" 

It seems that she and has a number of friends who are currently in MGM
301, and the question is apparently _up_ for many in the class, and
apparently it has been the cause of some concern, as illustrated by
the question and reflections below.

practice rollovers in previous semesters.

> For the next two hours, we were exactly like those people stuck in the
Pyrenees but not with one map but two. I told the team that we needed
to come to a decision a common ground, otherwise the strategies put
forward would have conflicting underlying assumptions. Oh, I
could see the other teams moving ahead with their strategies in
blissful ignorance while we were going to die in the mountains due
to information! So desperate was I that, I and 
the team) we visited Darl and Peter's office
three times. As it was outside office hours we were out of luck, I
resorted to email. I really didn't want to because I felt that I
would be able to better gauge the response with some cues. I
actually said this to Darl (in the email) and I got back a response
from Peter about trust, reliability (Full story at [Conspiracy
theory](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/archives/000266.html))

The RA and I spent a pleasant 15 minutes talking about her experiences of MGMT 301
and the _facts_ that people in her class believed about Net Mike. Our
discussion got me thinking about the way rumours seem to spread
through the class. I rarely think, or imagine, that people in the class
talk about the class to one another; that's probably a reflection of
my own undergraduate experience--we never talked about the class as
there was too much else going on. But, when remained about cases like
this, it is fascinating to me that there is a _grapevine_ and that it
is alive and well.

It seems to happen most semesters that some new _truth_ bubbles to the
surface about what is will happen in the future. I've never been able
to find out where these rumours start from. On the few times I've tried
to track them down, I can never get past the _I had a friend who did
the course a few years ago_; people are unwilling to share that
confidence.

Of course, what comes to my attention are the cases when the grapevine
disseminates bad information; I probably never hear about all the
times the grapevine is 100 per cent accurate. I'd be interested to
hear from the class (in the form of comments to this entry), about the
useful information that has come through the grapevine (and perhaps
how it has been useful). I say this, because I'm wondering if there
should be something extra in the black book.

Talking about the black book, I'm wondering if there is too much in
it--does information overload occur. Or, perhaps the black book
needs to provide a better map to aid people's understanding.

I could go on at some length about the things it would be helpful to
know from the class--we glean a lot of information from the meetings
with the teams, and from the assignments (that are yet to come). But
often, the impact of little details (like the article _How to win at
Net Mike_) do not get revealed to us in anything other than a
off-hand way.

What I'm saying is, that perhaps it would be helpful to have a more
complex and complete dialogue with people in the class--to see if
there is a better way than the grapevine--but I'm not sure of the
extent to which people want that sort of connection.
