I have come across some engaging material by [Terry
Doyle](https://learnercenteredteaching.wordpress.com/) that is intended
to help faculty "in moving from a teacher centered practice to a learner
centred one". What stands out for me is the way he draws on
contemporary neuroscience understanding of learning. His definition of
learning (given below) is a more developed version of what I have been
using for many years, and I think I prefer his over mine. It is:

> Learning is the ability to use information after a significant period
> of disuse
>
> and
>
> It is the ability to use the information to solve problems in a
> context different (if only slightly) from the context in which the
> information was originally <del>taught</del> learnt.

The change to the final sentence is mine rather than Terry's.
