I think it was Paula Jarzabkowski who talks about strategy isn't
something an organisation has, rather it is something an
organisation does, and thus we should talk about strategising rather
strategy. In the same way (may be it is Weick), we should talk about
becoming something, rather than being something. So for the class,
Business Policy & Strategy, I tend to think of
the students as people who are in the (endless) process of becoming
strategists[^1].

This is all prompted by a discussion I had with three students who
came to talk about this week's case, _Branson's Virgin_ (de Vries
& Dick, 1998). The came looking to find out what I wanted them to say--that
old chestnut of "How should I approach this case?" I think they were surprised
by the answer. I don't have an answer in mind; what I'm hoping for is that each
student will bring what they know (about strategy, or marketing, etc) to bear
on the case and to demonstrate that they understand what is going on in the
case _and_ what is going on in the class room. The second part came as a big
surprise to them. If we treat the class as a _strategy retreat_ or a _strategy
away day_, many of the problems we face in the class, of getting stuck or going
round in circles, are faced by strategists too. It isn't, after all, just about
having good ideas; it is also about understanding other's ideas, getting ones
own ideas accepted, integrating what other people have have said, keeping the
'conversation' going. Just think about what Mason & Mitroff (1981, 1998) said
about the way to talk wicked problems. It requires input from many people, so
part of what is desired is working with the rest of the class--not just
defending ones own position or point of view.

So, pragmatically, marks can be earned, not only by making sense of
the case (with a good dollop of theory), but also by synthesising
understanding from everything that is being said in the class. Such
synthesis can be started by something a simple as asking good
questions of one another, or by seeking clarification on peoples'
position.

Anyway, after the four of us finished talking, I was left really
looking forward to Friday and what they might do in class.

really is research informed learning.
