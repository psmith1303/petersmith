For those who know me, it my come as a little surprise that I do some quantitative based research and that my weapon of choice is [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Over the past couple of days, I have been analysing some data about the performance of students in courses. To start with, I have used correlations to get a feel for what relationships might exist.

I was having a problem with `corrplot` and `corrplot.mixed` and in working my way through the problem I came across this [page](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/08/05/a-visualization-error/) by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/) and his paper on [Data visualization in sociology](https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4203684). 

It was very helpful (and worth a read).

Anyway, here is one of my visualizations showing the correlations between the performance of a group of students between courses.

But there is a coincidence here. The template/design of this site ~~is~~ was largely based on Kieran's own site; if you have followed the links in this post, I am sure you will see the similarities.  Thanks Kieran!
