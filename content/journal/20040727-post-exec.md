After the 'exec' meetings yesterday, the three of us
([DPE]({{< relref "20040308-dpe.md" >}}))
got together to talk about the teams we had seen during the morning.
Despite that debriefing, it still takes me a long time to process
what I have seen and heard, and to think about the _Learning journals_
that people have written.

When we, DPE, originally talked about the
learning journals, we thought that it would take a few weeks before
people got 'into their stride' and began to do well in them. Judging by
the current crop that I've read, some people are setting a cracking
pace already. Not only that, most of the anticipated grades[^1] (of the
ones I read) are close, if not identical, to the grade I'm going to give
them. For a long time, I've said that students know the grade their
work deserves; this just seems to re-enforce my position.

There were a number of discussions that I found particularly
helpful (in the sense that I feel I understand a little better where
the students are coming from). Firstly, with one team we had a robust
discussion about the pros and cons of making assumptions--I think
this really leads into a discussion of how we construct our own
theories of the world. Perhaps so of the later readings will be
helpful with this, but many theories of learning, such as the Kolb
cycle (1976), are not predicated on the individual discovering
some fundamental, or scientific, truth. Rather, they are geared
towards people find out how to function 'better' in the world in which
they inhabit[^2]. This leads us to a very subjective view of the world
-- and I'm aware that some, or even many, students find that an
uncomfortable thought.

Second, is the issue of sharing information and learning. I hear
that with in some departments or faculties, with regard to team
projects, there is a culture of deliberately misleading other
teams--I presume this means feeding them wrong information. I
struggle to understand why someone would do this (either in a course,
or outside of university). It isn't as if there are a finite number
of As to go around[^3]. Related to that, was this issue of the ranking
of team members, and the intra-team competition that this might
generate. True, it is possible to construe it that way; however, it
isn't the only construction that can be placed on it. Later on, one of
the readings discusses catalytic mechanisms; and forced ranking is
an okay catalytic mechanism[^4].

[^3]: The argument for grading on the curve (and thus having a finite
number of As) is sometimes based on the idea that it encourages
competition, and thus raises standards. In this
[department](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20100505010923/https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/),
we mark to a standard, rather than to a bell-curve.

the class get it as an article (by him again) in the [Harvard Business
Review](https://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/relay.jhtml?name=itemdetail &id=4312&referral=8636)
