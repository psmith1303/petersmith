I had coffee with a good colleague today. [Richard
Brookes](https://web.archive.org/web/20081014125426/https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/tabid/542/upi/rbro070/Default.aspx)
is one of the superb teachers around
[here](https://business.auckland.ac.nz/).

We got on to the topic of what managers really need to know and the
issue of the relevancy of much management research.

As a result of our discussion, I am even more convinced of
the need to teach "judgement" in our MBA programmes. The challenge is that it's
hard to do that.

I think in my next undergraduate class, that I'll see how much
_buy-in_ I can get from the students to such an assertion (and
consequently, how much effort they'll put into developing better
judgement).
