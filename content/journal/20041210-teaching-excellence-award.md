I came back from ANZAM a little early, so that
I could attend the faculty Xmas bash. Part of the event consisted of
the awarding of *Teaching Excellence Awards*. Having been nominated
by Peter Boxall, and then spent some considerable time putting my
teaching portfolio together, I was hopeful of an "honourable
mention".

So, it was a wonderful surprise to actually get the award (and the
$3,000 grant that goes with it).

It was wonderful to have my colleagues, and more importantly my
students, recognise the effort I put into my teaching.

Whilst putting my portfolio together, I spent some time thinking
about *why* I'm a good teacher. To misquote Newton, if I have seen
better how to teach, it is only because I've stood on the shoulders of
giants. In other words, I've learnt a lot from the excellent
teachers who taught me, and the excellent teachers with whom I have
shared teaching. In alphabetical order they are (and apologies for
any omissions):

- Barbara Simpson
- Catherine Casey
- Chris Woods
- Darl Kolb
- David Barry
- Joline Francoeur
- Judith McMorland
- Judith Pringle
- Lisa Callagher
- Peter Boxall
- Richard Brooks
- Willie Smith

And of course, there are the many students who were tolerant (most of
the time), as I tried new things, and when I made mistakes.

So, thanks to everyone for your support.
