After talking with
[Darl](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/dkolb/), I've sent an email out
through _Cecil_ to the
[class]({{< relref "20040308-mgmt-301.md" >}}) about
journaling.

Possibly, more importantly, I've offered to host anyone in the class
who wants to maintain their journal on-line. I can think of several
advantages of doing this. Firstly, being a public forum, it might
encourage people to be more thoughtful about what they are writing.
Secondly, and also as a result of being public, it might help them to
commit more to doing the journal, i.e. It's that psychological
thing of making a public commitment. Finally, it could just be
out-and-out fun.

Of course there are some downsides. The system I'm using here,
[Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/), is one of the best
blogging systems and it can be pretty straight forward to use--but
if anyone wants to customise the look (and why shouldn't they) it can
take the notice sometime to get to grips with the complexity of the
system.

Oh well, I think I'll just sit back and see if there are any takers.
