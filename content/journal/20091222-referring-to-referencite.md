In writing my piece on
[referencing]({{< relref "20091222-referencing-here-and-now.md" >}}),
I just [Googled 'apa
referencing'](http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=apa+referencing) and here
are the first page of search results.

I was surprised by the results. First, I used Google.co.nz instead of
Google.com (I normally use the later), and secondly
the [University of Auckland's](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/) referencing
resource
[Referen©ite](https://web.archive.org/web/20090325081529/http://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/) did
not feature at all on the first page.

I see:

- www.waikato.ac.nz
- www.aut.ac.nz
- www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz
- library.ucol.ac.nz
- library.curtin.edu.au
- library.canterbury.ac.nz
- library.manukau.ac.nz
- www.southernoceansoftware.com
- owl.english.purdue.edu
- aut.ac.nz.libguides.com (again)

But there is no sign of Referen©cite. I wonder why Google does not
refer to Referen©ite on the first page (that's a rhetorical question;
I know how [search
engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine) rank sites).
