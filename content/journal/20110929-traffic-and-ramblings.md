There has been a little bump in traffic, so I've kicked off [AW
Stats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/ "AW Stats") process to workout
what/who/_etc_ is happening.

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Tick. Ding.

Okay, it looks like some of my current students have rumbled that this
blog exists. That's a bit later in the course than usual, but not
unexpected. Most are using computers at the
[University](https://web.archive.org/web/20110606044925/http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/ "The University of
Auckland"),
and a few are doing it from home. Looking at the logs, it's still a
surprise to me, how late (or early) they're using their computers; but I
guess I was the same when I was at their age. I recall pulling many
all-nighters as I worked on various projects.

So, to all the students from BUSINESS 101 and BUSINESS 102, welcome.  Oh,
and if any of the MGMT 302 or SCIENT 706 students are here, welcome too.

I think this will serve as a reminder that I need to be posting more
often, and perhaps posting more interesting stuff.

I finished writing the examination for BUSINESS 102 yesterday, and
Doug's be reviewing it today. I'm pretty pleased with it, and Dough
thinks that it is rather good. It's reminiscent of the previous one for
BUSINESS 101 and it covers the whole course. No doubt we'll be putting
up formal guidance on the form and style of the examination on
[Cecil](https://web.archive.org/web/20110606045738/http://www.cecil.auckland.ac.nz/login.aspx "Cecil--or CSL as it once was").

I wonder whatever happened to the person who said they wanted to work
through getting an A-grade concept map. Perhaps their assignment
workload caught up with them.
