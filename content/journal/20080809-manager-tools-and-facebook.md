I was talking with [Andrew](http://www.andrewisgettingfit.com) when he
happened to mention how many _friends_ he has on
[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=647536402) (about 477
today).

And then today, I listened to the [Manager Tools podcast of
Facebook](http://www.manager-tools.com/2008/07/the-myspace-cast-part-1-of-2/)
(and [part
2](http://www.manager-tools.com/2008/07/the-myspace-cast-part-2-of-2/)).

It makes interesting listening. I suspect that many of our students
would also find the ideas presented in the cast interesting too.
