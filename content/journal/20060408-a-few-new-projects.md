I'm working on a few projects at the moment.

Firstly, I'm setting up a couple of
[Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "What is a WikiWiki"). One
I'll use to create a resource for students doing the [MBA Research
Project](https://www.mbanotebook.ac.nz/index.php/Main_Page "MBA
Research Project").

The other will provide an overall guide _[The Auckland MBA&trade;](https://www.mbanotebook.ac.nz/ "Roadmap of the
Auckland MBA") programme.

Secondly, I'm playing around with podcasts. I think it might be a
useful way to promote the MBA programme to
potential students, and keep existing students informed of what is
happening.

Both the wiki and the podcasts have fairly steep learning curves.
Besides get the necessary software set up
([MoinMoin](https://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ "MoinMoin software") for
the wiki, and
[Audacity](https://audacity.sourceforge.net/ "Link to the main Audacity
site")
for recording and editing the podcasts) the issues of how to
structure both are quite interesting. For the Wiki the issue is one
of loose-tight structure; after all the site can be edited and
structured by almost anyone. For the podcast, whilst there are some
fairly specific "rules" on the format, selecting and creating the
content is tricky (given the structure).
