It was the last class of MGMT 302 _Business Policy
Strategy_ today. At the end of the class I played "Never can say Goodbye", 
and I came over all melancholy. The students have been a good bunch and 
I like them immensely. But, for various reasons, this is likely to be 
the last _Business Policy & Strategy_ course I teach for sometime.

Of course, I don't _own_ the course, but over the past five years, or
so, I have become attached to it. It will be strange not teaching it.
And so, yes, I am feeling melancholy (but not sad).

There is not much left to do with regard to the course, except:

1. Complete marking the assignments (which will be done on Tuesday)
2. Collate the marks (and send a copy out to the students)
3. Get the course assessor approve the marks (all courses here have
assessors--in fact I'm an assessor for a couple of courses)
4. Submit the marks to Examinations
5. Write-up my report on the course

And that's it. By the end of next week I should be able to file
everything to do with MGMT 301.
