To everyone who has posted their journals online, I'd like to express
my thanks to you for making your work publicly available.

I've enjoyed reading what you have written, and I think many members
of the class have benefited from seeing your work. They have been the
source for many discussions at the weekly 'Exec' meetings.

I had hoped that others would have provided you with more comments
online--but that type of culture takes more time than we have to
develop.

If you would like to keep using your online journal (in the way Amit
has), please do so.

Once again, thanks.
