[Jo Badge](https://drbadgr.wordpress.com/) and [Jon
Scott](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/cpp/staff/scott) have produced a
very interesting paper entitled [Dealing with plagiarism in the digital
age](https://evidencenet.pbworks.com/Dealing-with-plagiarism-in-the-digital-age).

In their concluding remarks, they argue that there is "little solid
empirical evidence to show the effectiveness of these [plagiarism
detection] tools in improving student practices". However, experience
here is that the use of [Turn It In](https://www.turnitin.com/) makes a
significant difference. I recall that a few years ago I did some pretty
sound analysis of levels of plagiarism in MGMT 191/192 and in MGMT 101
and there was clear evidence of changes in behaviour ... as manifested
in levels of plagiarism.

I do agree with Badge and Scott that the use of electronic detection
tools are only a "first step" in addressing plagiarism. We (Lisa
Callagher, Lynne Mitchelle, and I) developed a very good on-line
tutorial (called AHA, Academic Honesty Assistance) that was used in MGMT
191/192 and MGMT 101 for many years. I think it was the combination of
_Turn It In_ and _AHA_ that made the difference in the levels of
plagiarism. Perhaps that is what Badge and Scott are meaning, it was not
just the use of the detection tool that made the difference; it was the
combination of factors.

As a something of an aside, Badge and Scott point out there is a
[CiteULike group of plagiarism
articles](https://www.citeulike.org/group/11256). It contains many of the
'classics' to which I often refer, especially the [Good practice
guide](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/plagiarism/brookes.pdf)
from [Oxford Brookes](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/).
