Darl has asked me to set up a Wiki for his current MGMT 301 (Management Theory &
Practice) and MGMT 329 (Advanced Theory & Practice) classes. Well
its done and now the site [Bad Dog](http://baddog.ac.nz "Bad Dog") is up
and running.

The name of the site came from one of the symbols/characters used in the
simulation ... which we lovingly called "Bad Dog" (it is a picture of
a dog after all).

I hope current (and former) students contribute to the-wiki.
