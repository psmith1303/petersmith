It doesn't seem so long ago that I was
[commenting]({{< relref "20040727-on-becoming-a-critically-reflexive-practitioner.md" >}})
on a recent edition of the [JM](http://www.sagepub.com/journal.aspx?pid=181)
(well actually it was a couple of months). Anyway, I'm just reading
the latest edition 28(5), that is a special edition on _problem based
learning_.

The editors' introduction, Citing Gijselaers and Woltjer, talks
about the different ways of _knowing_ that seem to apply to novices
and experts. They say:

> ... novices tend to organise their knowledge representations
> around the specifics of the problem, where as experts move to the
> more abstract level to see the general principles.

How true this rang with my own experience. In my classes _Business policy &
strategy_ and _Management theory & practice_, (and to a lesser extent
_Organisation & Management_), I constantly see students anchoring on the
details of a problem and finding it hard to work with the more abstract
concepts. My experience has been that the more abstract a concept is, the
bigger a 'lever' it is, and the more universal it is. Alas, I've never found a
satisfactory way to get this across, and I suppose it is to be expected as it
is hard to shift one's anchor (there are some strong links here to sense-making
etc).
