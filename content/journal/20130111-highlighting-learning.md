suggests that highlighting information as a form of learning has little
real impact over simply reading the material. Yet, the evidence (and my
own experience) is that this a very popular way to aid 'learning'.

The truth is that we do many things because we believe them to be
effective, rather than because there is evidence that they actually are
effective. I wonder what else we do that provides us with a false sense
of security ... oh, yes, handing out copies of slides. That too doesn't
really help.
