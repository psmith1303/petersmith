Yale college has some of the [best resources on
writing](http://writing.yalecollege.yale.edu/writing-yale) that I have
come across. One of the challenges teachers face is to what extent
should they draw on others material, as opposed to writing their own
"guides".

For example, the Yale material does not quite fit in some areas. Should
I:

- Refer students to their resource and not worry about the few minor
 gaps/differences. In other words should I assume that students can
 bridge the gaps themselves
- Refer students, as above, but write some extra guidance to bridge
 the gaps
- Write my own guide from scratch that explicit meets all of our
 needs, but may not be as good overall as the Yale guide

Thinking about it, favour the first option. Students will, as they go
through life, be faced with gaps between what they know/find and what is
needed. They need to develop enough good judgement to do that
themselves. If I remove all ambiguity (the last two options above), how
can they develop that skill/expertise.
