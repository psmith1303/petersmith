The [Chronicle of Higher
Education](http://chronicle.com/article/Matching-Teaching-Style-to/49497/)
led me to an interesting article on learning styles by Pashler,
McDaniel, Rohrer, and Bjork (2009).

The summary of the article outlines the idea of learning styles:

> The term ''learning styles'' refers to the concept that individuals
> differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most
> effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend
> that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning
> style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning
> style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information
> presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech)
> and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or
> congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment
> instruments are extremely diverse. The most common--but not the
> only--hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles
> is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best
> provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner
> (e.g., for a ''visual learner,'' emphasizing visual presentation of
> information).
>
> The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the
> education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from
> kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted
> to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and
> many organizations offer professional development workshops for
> teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.

The article, commissioned by [Psychological Science in the Public
Interest](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118508815/home),
goes on to question what evidence there is to support these type of
practices; _i.e._, is there evidence that attending to learning styles
has a material impact on learning?

I think my first exposure to the notion of learning styles was through
[Darl](http://nz.linkedin.com/pub/darl-kolb/0/535/730)
[Kolb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100513125012/http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/5145.aspx) who gave me David
Kolb's (1976) classic article to read. One take-away I had from that
article was, that although we might have preferences (in our style of
learning) it is generally a good thing to be able to draw on all the
styles. In particular Kolb (1976, p. 30) says "When one perspective
\[learning style\] comes to dominate others, learning effectiveness is
reduced in the long run. From this we can conclude that the most
effective learning systems are those that can tolerate differences in
perspective". For Kolb (1976) and for Pashler _et al_., (2009) there is
clear--if not undisputed evidence--that people have preferences as to
how they learn. The question remains as to how much those preferences
should be accommodated in the educational process; is learning
ineffective, or less effective if learning styles are not taken into
consideration?

Having considered the evidence the conclusion Pashler _et al_., (2009)
draw is that, generally, the nature of the content should determine the
style of learning adopted. For example, the Chronicle of Higher
Education describes how learning about the structure of molecules is
better for most students (independent of learning styles) by building
ball-and-stick models. Even those students who have a preference for
verbal learning will do better if taught in this kinaesthetic manner
(rather that catering to their preference). The Chronicle says "teachers
should worry about matching their instruction to the content they are
teaching. Some concepts are best taught through hands-on work, some are
best taught through lectures, and some are best taught through group
discussions".

The fallacy that the authors seem to uncover is the argument that
"student X did not do well because the teaching did not accommodate their
particular learning style". If the learning style matches the content
(rather than the students preference) then usually the student will do
better.

Returning to Kolb (David not Darl), the Chronicle of Higher Education
reports that he says:

> that the paper's bottom line is probably correct: There is no strong
> evidence that teachers should tailor their instruction to their
> students' particular learning styles. (Mr. Kolb has argued for many
> years that college students are better off if they choose a major that
> fits their learning style. But his advice to teachers is that they
> should lead their classes through a full "learning cycle," without
> regard to their students' particular styles.)

So whither learning styles? For me, it means that the content should
determine the means of teaching.
