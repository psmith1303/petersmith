Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps:

* Sort
Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.

* Set in order
Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.

* Shine
Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.

* Standardize
Perform the process in the same way every time.

* Sustain
Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.
