Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.

- Kanban provides transparent visual feedback.
- Sometimes called a Scrum board

It provides
- Visualisation
- WIP limits
- Flow of work

The *Work-in-Progress Limit* or WIP Limit ensures that tasks are limited to what the team can actually handle during a certain amount of time.

The WIP Limit is decided by the whole team.

*Flow* A core principle that aims to maximize efficiency.

* Creating cards

Cards will vary in styleyou can even use sticky notes on a whiteboardbut most cards will contain a few key details about the task that they represent. When using physical cards, teams often use both sides. Here is what both sides of the card should include:

** Front

- Title and unique identifier: Make sure you have a quick reference for tasks and ID numbers.

- Description of work: Briefly describe the task to be accomplished. Remember that this is intended to be captured on something no larger than an index card.

- Estimation of effort: Estimate the amount of work it will take to complete the task. For example, you can write “small,” “medium,” or “large” to indicate the level of effort you think that task will involve.

- Who is assigned to the task: Indicate who is responsible for completing the task; ideally, one person per card.

** Back

- Start date: Include the start date of the task for use in metrics, tracking, and ensuring that your time estimate is accurate.

- Blocked days: Indicate which days your task may be halted. A task can become blocked if it can’t continue to be worked on. For example, if you were supposed to receive a deliverable and it hasn’t been delivered yet, then your day may be blocked for this particular task.

- Finish date: As with any plan, it is important to track when the task is supposed to be finished. This allows you to ensure that your project is still on track to reach the end goal.

* Kanban board software

If you opt to use a software tool rather than a physical board, you have a few options. Asana and Trello are both great software tools to use if you are looking to introduce Kanban to your project. There are many options, so take the time to evaluate which is best for you and your project.

* Summary
Kanban is both an Agile approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”
