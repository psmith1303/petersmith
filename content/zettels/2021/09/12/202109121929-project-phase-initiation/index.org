Project initiation begins after a problem or an opportunity has been identified in the organization.

In this phase the project manager needs to identify:

- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
- What is the purpose and mission of the project?
- What are the measurable objectives for the team?
- What skills and resources will the project require?

- What is the project trying to improve?
- When does this project need to be completed?
- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

All of this will allow the project manager to solidify the scope or the boundaries of the project.

Overall, good initiation will ensure that he benefits of the project will outweigh it's costs.
