1. Define value
   identify and focus on what the customer wants and include the customer.

2. Map value stream
   Map out the steps to production and challenge all the wasted steps.

3. Create flow
   Ensure that the product flows through the value stream efficiently, eliminating wast throughout the cycle.

4. Establish pull
   Ensure that the customer is "pulling" on the product through this stream by asking for features and incremental deliveries.

5. Pursue perfection
   Push the team to continuously improve the first four process steps.
