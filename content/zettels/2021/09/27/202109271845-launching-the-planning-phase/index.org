Project plans don't have to be perfect the first time

Three things are needed:
1. The schedule
2. The budget
3. The risk management plan

* Schedule
The project timeline, which includes the start date, the end date, and the dates for events in between

* Budget
The budget accounts for the total cost to complete the project

* Risk management
Searching for possible problems related to the project and planning ahead of time to mitigate these risks
