A formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach its goals.

Like the project proposal, the project charter serves a similar purpose inasmuch as it influences and persuads the company to move forward with the project and often comes at the end of the initiation phase. However, its goal is to more clearly define the key details of the project. Another difference between these two documents is that a charter will often serve as a point of reference throughout the life of a project

The project charter makes it clears the project benefits outweigh its costs.

Once the project sponsor and the stakeholders have review and agreed the project charter, the project manager has authority to move forward with the project.


Creating a project charter is a best practice for ensuring that everyone agrees on how to move forward before entering the planning phase.

* Project charters: Elements and formats

A project charter clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. A well-documented project charter can be a project manager’s secret weapon to success.

The charter is the formal way that the project’s goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your project charter to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the project charter carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

As with any of your project documents, it is a good idea to collaborate with your team and stakeholders early and often. Developing the project charter in collaboration with both groups can help you make sure that your project charter addresses your key stakeholders’ most important concerns and keeps your team aligned. Be sure to use the business casethe reason for initiating the projectas the guiding direction to your project charter. Project charters can vary from organization to organization and from project to project. It is key for a project manager to identify the best type of charter for the project in order to capture the relevant information and set your project up for success.

Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:

- introduction/project summary
- goals/objectives
- business case/benefits and costs
- project team
- scope
- success criteria
- major requirements or key deliverables
- budget
- schedule/timeline or milestones
- constraints and assumptions
- risks
- OKRs
- approvals

You will likely use many different project charter formats throughout your project management career. One example is a condensed, simplified document, like the one you'll learn about in the upcoming video and the one linked in the activities. A short and simple project charter can be used on smaller projects that are not very complex.

For more complex projects, you may link to additional analysis or documents. You can house these items in the appendix.

Your organization may have a unique template for you to use, or you may have the flexibility to leverage one you come across in your career. As your project progresses, you may also encounter revisions to your project charterand that is okay. Remember, it is a living document; let it grow with your project, and review and revisit it often to ensure you are aligned.
