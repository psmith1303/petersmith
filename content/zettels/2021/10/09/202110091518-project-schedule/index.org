The anchor of a good project plan is a clear schedule, containing all the tasks fo a project, their owners and when they need to be completed.

One way to do this is with a Gantt Chart

* Gantt chart
A horizontal bar chart that maps out a project schedule. Named after Henry Gantt.

A highly visual representation of a project's tasks with a clear breakdown of who is responsible for the work and when those tasks are due.


They should show:
- Milestones
  - and their tasks
- Task owners
- Start dates
- End dates
- Percentage complete
