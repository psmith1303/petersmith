Understanding organizational culture and the change management process is crucial when introducing new ways of working. Organizational culture is based on shared workplace values and pops up in people's behaviours, activities, the way they communicate, and how they work with each other.


* Change management
The process of getting folks to adopt a new product, process, or in Agile's case, a new value system.

"Change takes patient persistence"

1. Create a sense of ownership
   - Find an executive sponsor who feels a sense of ownership for the change you are creating.
   - Having buy-in from someone at the top increases your chances of successfully driving any change in organizational culture.
2. Create a sense urgency
   - Ask questions about what's work and what's not working right now.
   - Ensure the changes connect to those things
