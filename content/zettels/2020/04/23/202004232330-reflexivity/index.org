According to Booth (2000), reflexivity may "be defined in this sense as a general scepticism towards one's own and others' knowledge or truth claims)". It is about questioning what one takes to be true (either explicitly or implicitly).

Figure 1: A Taxonomy of Reflexivities

- Mechanical Reflexivity:
  - Knee-jerk reflexivity (reflexivity  as habitual response to
    stimulus)
  - Cybernetic loopiness (Reflexivity as property of feedback systems)
  - Reflections ad infinitum (Reflexivity as Escherian loop or hall of mirrors)

- Substantive Reflexivity:
  - Systemic-reflexivity (Reflexivity as organizing principle in late modernity)
  - Reflexive social construction (Reflexivity as property of intersubjective
    relations)

- Methodological Reflexivity:
  - Philosophical self-reflection (Reflexivity as self-knowledge)
  - Methodological self-consciousness(Reflexivity as aid to correcting bias)
  - Methodological self-criticism (Reflexivity as communal or individual
    critical
  - Methodological self-congratulation (Reflexivity as property of specific
    research programmes)

- Meta-theoretical Reflexivity:
  - Reflexive objectification (Reflexivity as detached hyper-objectivity)
  - Standpoint reflexivity (Reflexivity as existential engagement with
    marginalised standpoints)
  - Breaking frame (Reflexivity as exposure of theatricality of
    taken-for-granted reality)

- Interpretative Reflexivity:
  - Hermeneutic reflexivity (Reflexivity as toolkit for sociological
    interpretation and exegesis)
  - Radical referential reflexivity (Reflexivity as problematization of
    representation and objectification)

- Ethnomethodological Reflexivity:
  - Ethnomethodological reflexivity (Reflexivity as everyday property of
    networks of entities, practices and interactions)
