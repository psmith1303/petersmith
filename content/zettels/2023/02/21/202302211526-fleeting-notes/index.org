Fleeting notes are transitory notes, that can be made throughout the day. E.g., writing down the price of an airline ticket.

They should be recorded in some sort of in-box, e.g., my little transitory notebook, so they can be processed into the Zettelkasten if needed.

When they (and the in-box is reviewed), they can be transformed into [[{{< ref "202302211533-permanent-notes" >}}][permanent notes]], archived, or discarded.
