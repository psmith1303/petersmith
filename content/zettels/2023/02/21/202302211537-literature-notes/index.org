Literature notes are records of resources such as articles, books, web-pages, and so on.

The notes are specifically about the content of the resources; they are not a place of synthesis.

Literature notes are often stored in a system separate from [[{{< ref "202302211533-permanent-notes/" >}}][permanent notes]]. I keep my literature notes in the [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] bibliography software/system.

Overall, one needs to be selective as to what is added as a literature note; it's an exercise in collecting stuff. The question to ask is "In what way is this item relevant/useful/interesting vis-รก-vis my research?"
