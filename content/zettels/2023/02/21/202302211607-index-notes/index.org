Index notes, are where you collect similar notes together to create some sort of index of ideas. In this way structure begins to image from the individual ideas --- rather than the simple links between ideas.

The index notes provide a structure for a topic or a concept. For example, my entry on the [[{{< ref "202302201536-zettelkasten" >}}][Zettelkasten method]] is something of a structure note.

That said, index notes should reflect interests in broader topics such as Programming, Art, Music, Learning -- they are the big ideas that you are working with.
