The academic process, sounds so straight forward when laid out like this

1. Reading and understanding what has been read
2. Remembering what has been read
3. Referencing and citing what has been read
4. Choosing your research conversation
5. Designing the research
6. Conducting the research
   1. Data collection
   2. Data Processing
   3. Data analysis
7. Writing-up
8. Revising
9. Gathering Feedback
10. Publishing

Although the list looks like a linear process it is more complex than that; there many times of looping back and of iteration.
