The title of this is a pun on "work, work, work" said by [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000316/][Mel Brooks]] in [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/][Blazing saddles]]. Of course he isn't doing any really work---but I was.

I chose to go into to school to write, and it's been a really productive day. With now real distractions, or easy diversions, I just got on with the task at hand---writing. Well, I did have a few minutes diversion, printing out the complete [[https://www.auckland.ac.nz/cir_research/index.cfm?action=display_page&page_title=Res_PBRFreport][PBRF]] and apparently tying up the printer for hours (I didn't hang around for it, and
it's over 250-pages).
