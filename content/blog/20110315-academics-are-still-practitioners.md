The discussion regarding forms and types of practitioners continues
with
[John Postill](https://johnpostill.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/academics-are-practitioners/\#comment-3722).

As I say on his site:

I don't know if I've said it already, but John is one of the writers on
practices who has been rather influential in my thinking (and whose
site [media/anthropology](https://johnpostill.wordpress.com/) has help to
clarify and number of things for me).
