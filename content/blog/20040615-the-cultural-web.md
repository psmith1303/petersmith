I was talking [Rachel](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/rwolfgramm)
about some of the work she has been doing with regards to strategy in
Maori organisations. We digressed on to Johnson's (1992) and since
neither of us had a slide on it, I quickly made this copy using
PowerPoint (it looks much better full-size; just click on the image).
In analysing any organisation, understanding what is going on
inside it is important---and the cultural web helps with just that. I
think it is one of Gerry's most practical contributions to
strategy.
