I've was reading Wilson, D. C., & 
Jarzabkowski, P. (2004). Thinking and acting strategically: New
challenges for interrogating strategy. _European Management
Journal, 1_, 14---20. It talks about many things, of which I Will say
more later, but I was intrigued by the references to an article by
Emirbayer Mische. So, I got a copy---all 62 pages, and have spend the
past four hours or so reading it.

> Emirbayer, M., & Mische, A. (1998). What is
agency? _American Journal of Sociology, 4_, 962--1023.\_

The abstract says:

> This article aims (1) to analytically disaggregate agency
into its several component elements (though these are interrelated
empirically), (2) to demonstrate the ways in which these agentic
dimensions interpenetrate with forms of structure, and (3) to point
out the implications of such a conception of agency for empirical
research. The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally
embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its
'interational' or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the
future (as a "projective' capacity to imagine alternative
possibilities) and toward the present (as a "practical-evaluative'
capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within
the contingencies of the moment) But that hardly does it justice.

This is a marvellous synthesis and re-conceptualisation of
_human agency_. It's clear why Wilson & Jarzabkowski (2004) used it in their
EMR[^1] article .

I particularly liked the article for two reasons. Firstly, it
situates the concept of _agency_ in history. This represents one
of my own personal peccadilloes---I always like to know the "story"
behind something; it's one of the way I make sense of things. The range
of ideas the article draws on is impressive (even considering its
length): Turner, Bourdieu, Parsons, Mead, Weber, Lacan, Aristotle,
Kant---all the usual suspects. The trick is the skillful
integration and synthesis of ideas.

For me this has to be the definitive article on agency. Five stars!  As I was
reading the article, I had a sense of strong links with the underpinnings of
psychodrama. After all, much of psychodrama is about being more agentic---or as
they[^2] say, helping people to exhibit more spontaneity---to be able to act in
new (less "routine') ways. If I had some time, it would be fun to try and do a
point by point comparison between the article and psychodrama.  Talking of
psychodrama, where is the new theory in psychodrama coming from? Is there any
new theory. Most of what I read seems to be reinterpretations and expositions
of the works of the masters[^3].  (Of course, my knowledge of psychodrama isn't
great, so I'm probably missing out on whole chunks of that literature.)

e-mail list. There was a special edition of the journal (regarding
strategy-as-practise) which was available
