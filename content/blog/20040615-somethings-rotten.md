I've noticed that when I quote something, by using block-quotes, e.g.

> block quotes

---That the subsequent paragraphs don't display correctly under Internet
Explorer-. They are fine with [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/). I suppose I
should look into at some stage. Alas, the only time I have is at home, and
their I don't use Microsoft... So it might have to wait until the next time I
work during the weekend (which should be a long time away).  

_I've fixed it_.

Alas, Internet Explorer doesn't handle having a left border and no right border
well. Removing the borders and colouring the blockquote gets around the
problem. I found this by accident.
