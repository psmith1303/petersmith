After my little [[{{< relref "20040508-a-wake-up-call/index.org" >}}][scare]], I'm doing many things to try and put the problem (well at least the majority of the medication) behind me. In many ways it is the "usual suspects', viz:

- Exercise
- Weight loss
- Diet
- Low sodium food (less than 1,500 mg per day)
- and, of course, medication

For exercise, I'm doing a bit of walking. (Well that's pretty much all I'm allowed to do.) So, each day I try and walk 10,000 steps. My progress is shown in the graph. The red line is my daily average; the blue band is my target.

So far, the exercise (and everything else) seems to be having a pay-off. I do feel that I've lost some weight. I've actually had to tighten my belt a couple of notches---and some of my clothes seem to be a bit baggy.

I took the idea from Lisa---she's been doing it for over a year now---and she is definitely fitter and slimmer. The trick is to buy a pedometer and record what you actually do. I find it is a great motivator.

I'll probably never get off all the medication, but I hope to minimise my dependency on it.
