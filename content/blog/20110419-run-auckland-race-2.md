Sunday was the second race in the Run Auckland series. This time it was
at [Te
Atatu](https://maps.google.com/?q=https://share.abvio.com/4df8/7197/4cb5/61b3/Runmeter-Run-20110417-0901.kml).

The first lap, of 5K, I pretty much match [my time for the first
[run]({{< relref "20110328-run-auckland-race-1.md" >}}) in the series. However, I
slowed down a lot in the second lap. I wonder how much that was because
(a) I had been taking it easy for 10 days because of my hamstring, and
(b) I had no-one to chase ... because I started at the front of the
pack, I was being chased instead.
