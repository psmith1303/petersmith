As I've mentioned
[before]({{< relref "20040319-the-rumour-mill.md" >}}),
one of the things I'm researching is the organisation and management of law
firms. This research is based on work done by [John
Gray](https://www.aegis.uws.edu.au/Staff/TEXT/John%20Gray.htm). It's taken
almost a year to get everything into place but last Friday we sent out the
surveys.  I had a couple of emails yesterday about the survey, but today,
completed survey forms have started to arrive. So far I have a 2 per cent
response rate---I hope to get that up to over 80 per cent. Once I get back from
[EGOS](https://www.egosnet.org), and my Research Assistant gets back from
Australia, we'll start following up with the outstanding firms. _It really is
nice_ that the firms have responded so promptly, and that they have taken the
time to complete the survey.

On a technical level, the research is really designed to do two things.
Firstly, we hope to find the extent to which law firms are moving from the P2
form (professional partnership) towards the MPB (managed professional
business). I'd also like to compare the aggregated results with the results
from Australia and Canada (and maybe the UK if they are ready). There are some
practical implications of this which I will discuss at a later date.  It is
also design to confirm some results of [Stan
Malo's](https://www.cob.sjsu.edu/malos_s/) work on Options Theory in law firms
and on they way the firms manage progression of professional staff through the
firm.

My hope is that in doing this work, beside producing useful research outputs,
I'll be kept at the forefront of the literature of professional service
firms---which will be a big pay-off for my PhD.
