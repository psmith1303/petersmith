Last night, on the spur of the moment, Lisa and I decided to go and see [Shrek
2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298148/). What a hoot. It was very funny
film. There were so many in-jokes, allusions and references to other movies
(e.g. a giant gingerbread man that was reminiscent of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow
Man in [Ghost Busters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/), which itself was a
parody of the Pillsbury Dough Boy) I think the animation is the best I've seen.
Look out for some of the details on Prince Charming (e.g. his mole, the way his
clothes are rumpled, the movement of his hair). However, like many animated
features there are times where the animation isn't up to the same high
standard.

Two performances really stood out---[Antonio
Banderas](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000104/) as Puss in Boots and [Jennifer
Saunders](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766837/) as the Fairy Godmother. In
particular, the songs ("Holding Out for a Hero" and "Fairy Godmother Song" )
sung by Jennifer were very well done; I didn't know she could sing that
well---this will be one sound-track I have to buy.  All in all, another one for
the DVD collection.
