I do quite like
[Pelican](https://stackful-dev.com/easier-pelican-blogging-with-fabric-automation.html).
It feels pretty clean. The rough edge is the creation of the metadata when
creating a new post.
[Stackful.io](https://stackful-dev.com/easier-pelican-blogging-with-fabric-automation.html)
gives a way for doing it using [Fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/), but it feels
kind of clunky. I need to find a better way to do it. Otherwise, one of my main
goals in moving to Pelican---to simplify things so I write more---will be lost.

Talking of automation, I dropped my auto (oh, that's a bad segue) off to
[Nicholson Panelbeaters](https://www.nicholsonpanelbeaters.co.nz) today. I got
rear-ended a few days ago when I stopped at the lights at the motorway on-ramp.
Alas, the car (CRV) behind me didn't notice me until it was a bit late :(

So, my car is in for a few thousand dollars worth of repairs.
