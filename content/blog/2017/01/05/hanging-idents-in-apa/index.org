As I have mentioned elsewhere, I am writing using markdown formatted files, and converting them to PDFs using =pandoc= and associated tools.

Alas, I noticed today that the reference list is produced without hanging indents (which is an APA requirement). Grrr. After some searching, I found that currently =pandoc-citeproc= does not (yet) support hanging indents. However, there is a work around. Currently, my =.md= files end with a couple of lines that look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC markdown
References
==========
#+END_SRC

What is needed is a little bit of latex 'code' to make the rest of the document use hanging paragraphs --- and thus work. I.e.,

#+BEGIN_SRC latex

References
==========

\setlength{\parindent}{-1.24cm}
\setlength{\leftskip}{1.24cm}
\setlength{\parskip}{8pt}

#+END_SRC

And then I have a beautifully formatted reference list.
