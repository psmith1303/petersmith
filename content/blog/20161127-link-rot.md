Over the years this site has gone through many incarnations as I have
changed platforms; Hugo, Pelican, WordPress, MovableType, and so on.

One by product has been that some of the internal links between posts,
journal articles, what have you, became broken because of the variety
of ways of referring to pages. In the past I have done the occasional
sweep to try and fix these. Over the past couple of days, I have been
fixing most of the broken internal links and some of the broken
external links.

Using https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/ I see that I still have several
hundred broken links to fix, and I am slowly working my way through
them.

For the links to external pages that no longer exist, I am trying to
used the appropriate copy archived by
the [Wayback machine](https://archive.org/web/).

Of course sometimes, that is not possible. Either the Internet Archive
does not have a copy, or the sites `robots.txt` file. At that point, I
just leave the link pointing to the original---now missing--source.
