[Lisa](http://www.yellowoasis.org/) and I went
to see [The Pillowman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillowman)
tonight.

It was marvellous. We both enjoy a black comedy and this was very black and
very fun. The crucification scene was particularly well done---and particularly
harrowing. Hat's off to [Brooke
Williams](http://www.aucklandactors.co.nz/ViewFullCV.pl?objectID=519) for a
great performance.

I also thought that Jonathan Hardy was very droll as the policeman Tupolski.

All in all, I recommend this play.
