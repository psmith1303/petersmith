Like [many other
people](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10164909--16.html), I'm
concerned about the recent changes in Facebook's terms of service.
Especially, when I read how their [terms of service
compare](http://amandafrench.net/2009/02/16/facebook-terms-of-service-compared/)
This is doubly true now that I've read the [New
Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/) article on the subject.

So, being unable to delete my Facebook account, I've:

- turned off as many "applications" as possible
- limited my visibility to others as much as possible
- deactivated my account

Facebook is dead to me, and hopefully, I'm dead to Facebook.
