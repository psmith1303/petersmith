Where customer strategic value will be increased by combining products and/or services from a building supplier, the supplier that organises so as to recognise and adjust to the customer strategic needs by offering an optimal package, will be able to bid a higher price, competitors not combining their offerings in such a way, and yet offering similar strategic value to the customer and record a similar probability of success i.e. the integrated builder will make a higher expected profit.
