It's been awhile since I've had a fitness assessment. The last times
were in 2002 and 2004. So, here we are, about 10 years on from the
first
one. Let's compare today's results with history.



|                | _Today_ |   _2004_ |    _2002_ |
|------------|------:|-------:|--------:|
| Weight (Kg)    | 79.5    | 99.08    | 111.25    |
| Height (cm_    | 174     | 176      |       173 |
| Blood pressure | 135/80  | ---      |    150/90 |
| Resting-pulse rate (bpm) | 52 | 60 | 102 |
| _Body composition_ |
| Triceps | 13mm | 24mm | 27mm |
| Subscapular | 21mm | 27mm | 28mm |
| Suprapsinal | 18mm | 26mm | 41mm |
| Medial calf | 27mm | 32mm | |
| Sum of skin folds | 114mm | 132mm | |
| Hip to waist | 0.97 | 0.92 | 1.02 |
| Body fat | 17% | | | 
| _Astrand Submaximal Cycle Erometer test_ |
| Estimated VO2 Max | 49.18 | 33.0 | 15.6 |
| _Flexibility_ |
| Sit & reach | Excellent | Very good | Good |
| Thomas test | Left normal, right good. Flexors good. ITB left, excellent, ITB right, below min |  Left quad a little tighter than the right, hip flexors good | Tight quads, hip flexors good |
| Shoulder assessment | Below minimum | Okay | Good |
| _Strength_ |
| Push ups | 10 (wimped out) | 19 | | 
| Sit ups  | 14 | 9 | | 


Of course, this is all age dependent.

So, my body fat is 17%. This is in the good range, but I'd like to
loose
another 10Kg. The trainer (Aimee) reckons that with the weight (muscle)
I'll put on from training, I should only get a 5Kg reduction, and
that---in combination---will take my fat down to about 10% (and
apparently, we don't want to go much lower than that).

So, some interesting changes and improvements. Clearly running has had a
good impact, but I've been neglecting some parts of my body.

I wonder what I might do about my shoulders.
