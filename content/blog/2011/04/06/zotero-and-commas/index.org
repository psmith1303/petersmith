One of the students in BUSINESS 101 noticed that in a reference such as (Oram, 2007; 2011) I was using colons, instead of commas. They said it should be (Oram, 2007, 2011). I was away from the office (without a copy of the Publication manual of the APA to hand), and I said it might just be a difference between the 5th and 6th editions. Being a long-time user of Zotero (and before that Endnote), I have stopped worrying about how my citations look. I take it for granted that they are correct.

/I was wrong./ It should have been (Oram, 2007, 2011).

As a result, [[https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/17356/semicolions-in-apa-6th][I have reported it]] to the good folk at [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]]. They say it should be fixed in the next day or two. I'll refresh my styles next week and see what happens.

So, thanks to the student (whose name I no longer have) for pointing that out.
