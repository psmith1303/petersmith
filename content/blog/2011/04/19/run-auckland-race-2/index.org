Sunday was the second race in the Run Auckland series. This time it was at [[https://maps.google.com/?q=https://share.abvio.com/4df8/7197/4cb5/61b3/Runmeter-Run-20110417-0901.kml][Te Atatu]].

Race results for race two in the 2011 RUN Auckland series

The first lap, of 5K, I pretty much matched my time for the first [[{{< ref "run-auckland-race-1" >}}][run]] in the series. However, I slowed down a lot in the second lap. I wonder how much that was because (a) I had been taking it easy for 10 days because of my hamstring, and (b) I had no-one to chase ... because I started at the front of the pack, I was being chased instead.
