I've been using [[https://www.movabletype.org/][Movable Type]] for a long time now. But its somewhat idiosyncratic develop, the frequent inability for themes/styles/templates to migrate between versions has proven to be too much. So, I'm making the switch to [[https://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] (version-3.0.4).

No doubt I've broken a few things in doing the export/import; but hopefully I can fix them as soon as I figure out what is broken.
