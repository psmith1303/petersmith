A new marathon personal record (PR) of 3:43:55 . In hindsight I probably made the rookie mistake of going out too fast at the start of the race ... I was certainly telling myself that around the 30k mark (where I found it increasingly hard to hit my target pace). It was great to see [[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605192809/https://www.dailymile.com/people/kiwikim21][Kim W.]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120824182640/https://www.dailymile.com/people/louiseshrimpton][Louise S.]] [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120824182640/https://www.dailymile.com/people/AndrewE][Andrew E.]] and Malcolm. Perhaps the hardest part of the race was trying to stand up after I had sat on the floor to remove my timing-chip. All in all, I happy to have beaten my previous record by 19 minutes. Note to self; is that a BQ time for my age group ... no, needed 3:30 for Boston or New York. Oh well, that's just a 13 minute improvement or 20 second reduction in my average pace :)

My soft goal was 5:30, my firm goal was 5:10, and my hard goal was 5:00 ... so I ended up half-way between my soft goal and my firm goal. Okay, there are a few lessons there.

The official results are below. I'm blown away to be in the top 18% and 22 out of 123 in my age group.

For the first half of the marathon, my average pace was 5:03 whereas for the second half I managed 5:33. You can can clearly see the slowdown from hitting "the wall".

I need to do more long distance training (beyond 32Km), some low heart-rate training, and sort out my nutrition during races. That should all help to delay the onset on "the wall'.
