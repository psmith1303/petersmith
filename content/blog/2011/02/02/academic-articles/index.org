I've talked about [[https://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/][Research as a Second Language]] [[{{< ref "research-as-a-second-language" >}}][before]].

I've been particular taken by the systematic way in which Thomas Basb√∏ll takes to pieces (and puts back together again) the art, craft, or science of academic writing.

I think his latest thoughts on [[https://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/2011/02/five-at-time.html][writing an academic article]] is particularly helpful. I'll have to let some of my co-authors see this.
