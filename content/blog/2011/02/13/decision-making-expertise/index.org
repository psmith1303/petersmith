Yates has elsewhere defined a decision as "a commitment to a course of action that is intended to yield results that are satisfying for specified individuals" (2003, p.Â 24).

When thinking about expertise in the context of decision-making, there are a number of ways one might identify /decision quality/.

From the /satisfying-results perspective/, a high quality decision is one that achieves the intended results. Whereas, there are a number of argues why such view is unsatisfactory. One argument that I find compelling, in this regard, is that that decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty, and therefore any evaluation of a decision must focus on the stakes and the odds, rather than the outcome. And so, from the /coherence perspective/, a high quality decision is that is "logically coherent, inasmuch as it is not self-contradictory.

However, that is easier said than done ... as all kinds of biases may enter the picture. For example, give a few cases, people may generalise a rule about those cases, but upon getting new (and contradictory cases) they will tend to discount/ignore the new cases. Given that decisions are often a social construction, and as a result people often conflate subject matter expertise with decision-making expertise.

A different approach is that offered by the /process-decomposition perspective/. In this perspective the overall process of decision-making is 'decomposed' into individual elements. The argument being that, if all the elements are executed well the decision-making is likely to be good. Although t is hard to know how to effectively split decisions into elements, research in many fields have arrived at what is called the /cardinal decision issue perspective/. It looks something like:

Such an approach, as shown in the figure above, is often used in root-cause analysis.
