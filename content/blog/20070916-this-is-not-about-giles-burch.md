This evening Lisa and I went to a diner party hosted by [Giles
Burch](http://www.gilesburch.com) and Catherine. It was a most enjoyable
evening.

Giles' parents were at the dinner too. As always, they were very convivial
company. Afterwards, I thought I would [Google](http://www.google.com/) his
father as he has a number of achievements to his name---but I came
[up](http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4995430.html)

I wonder if his generation is the last generation whose past won't be written
indelibly on the web.
