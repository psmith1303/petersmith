Lisa Callagher and I were invited to give a Professional Development session by the /Innovative Teaching and Learning Group/ (ITL) here at the Business School. Our topic was /Group Assessment/.

In previous sessions ITL had folk talk about *what* they do in regards to group assessment. For example, what happens in BUSINESS 101/102 or in MGMT 300.

The brief that Lisa and I had was to explain *why* we do what we do.

Overall, our message was:

1. If students are doing group work that does not mean you need to do group assessment
2. Be clear why you are assessing groups; i.e., the educational goals/purpose
3. Make sure you have group management/processes in place

Our {{< href src="GroupAssessmentPD-2018.pdf" caption="presentation" >}} slides are available if you want them.
