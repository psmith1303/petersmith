After a rather busy week, and a busy day in town, we decided to kick back and relax by going to see [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/][Crazy Rich Asians]]. It had gotten some good reviews by [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj][Simon and Kermode]] so we were pretty sure we were on to a good thing.

Correct! It was really good romp with excellent performances and it more than passed the "five laughts" test. Best comedy of the year, so far.

Constance Wu was great in the lead, and Gemma Chan (Mia in the series Humans). But for me Awkwafina stole the show; her character (Peik Lin Goh) was priceless.

All in all, a good laugh.
