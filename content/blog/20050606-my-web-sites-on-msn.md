Sometime ago I created a Passport account. In doing so a web folder
was created in _My Network Places_. It appears as a _file_
called _My Web Sites on MSN_.

All well and good.

Now I have an iPod and I keep a copy of my "C:Documents and
Settings" as I figure all my documents, etc are stored there. Alas, every time
I plug my iPod in to a Windows PC it finds
the _web folder_ and stars prompting me to connect (using Passport)
to the MSN network---and in doing so it
blocks the correct mounting (and unmounting) of the iPod. This
happens despite me telling Windows not to do anything with the disk
drive that is the iPod.

Anyway, I've deleted the file _My Web Sites on MSN_ and now I no
longer get Windows demanding that I login to Passport.

At one stage I thought that perhaps Microsoft was spying on the music
that I had installed on my iPod. But, of course, they weren't.

_Update 10 September 2008_
This page is one of the most popular on my site. There are many
"arrivals' here from people who have searched for "My Web Sites on MSN".
Indeed, the search term "my web sites on msn"
is the most search phrase that delivers people to this site.

If I [Google](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=%22my+web+sites+on+MSN%22) the
phrase [my web sites on MSN](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/308412), the first
entry is a link to Microsoft, and the second one is a link to this page.

According to Microsoft:

> The My Web Sites on MSN folder is added
to My Network Places (and appears in common dialog boxes) after you
use the Web Publishing Wizard or the Add Network Place Wizard to
create or add files to your MSN Web site.
>
> Microsoft offers free storage on the MSN Web
site for Passport customers. If you do not have a Passport, you are
prompted to create an account when you use the Web Publishing
Wizard or the Add Network Place Wizard. If you are not signed in with
your Passport account, you are prompted to sign in when you open the
"My Web Sites on MSN" folder. A Passport
account allows Microsoft to map your files to your security-enhanced
Passport account, which helps add security and privacy to your files
and makes sure that no one else can access your files.


With the change of version of [Movable
Type]({{< relref "20080806-yet-another-upgrade.md" >}})
the words in the page names of this blog are now separated by a hyphen
instead of an underline. I wonder how long it will be until this
becomes a popular page again.- So I have set up a redirect to ensure
searches from Google end up on the right page and don't get a [404
error](https://www.404errorpages.com/)
