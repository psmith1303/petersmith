It's Christmas, so it is time to do some upgrades. Firstly, let's move
to the latest version of [Movable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/).
Well the process was pretty straight forward, but upgrading the
templates broke my layout. So, I guess I'll have to spend some time
fixing that.

So, I quickly reinstalled the original templates, and everything seems
to be back in-order.
