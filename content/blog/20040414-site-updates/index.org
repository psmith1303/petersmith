I've made a couple of changes to the site. Firstly, on [[https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org][The reflective practitioner]], I have arranged to display links to the first few new comments that have been made. This can be seen on the left hand side of the main [[https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org][site]]. I've also changed the way entries from the individual blogs are aggregated and presented on the main site---this will hide some of my longer (and more tedious) entries.

On my own site, [[https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/ps/][site]], I've changed the templates so that a word count is displayed for each entry---this also happens on the main [[https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org][site]] too.  By the way, if your blog is hosted here and you see a blog style elsewhere that you like (e.g., at [[https://www.movablestyle.com/][this site]]) let me know, and I'll change your site too (if you can't do it yourself)).
