I've installed the necessary meta tags
for
[GeoURL](https://web.archive.org/web/20040412160322/http://www.geourl.org/) to
work with this site. You can see the registered sites that are
physically close to this
one,
[here](http://geourl.org/near/?p=http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org).
It's surprising how many sites there are around here. If you like
things more visually, have a look at
the
[maps](https://web.archive.org/web/20130324010027/http://geourl.org/near?lat=90&long=-180).
