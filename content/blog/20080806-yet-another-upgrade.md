It's been a long time coming, but I finally got around to upgrading
the version of [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.com) that I use on
this site.

It was as painless and problem free process that one could hope for.
Just install the new files, copy over the configuration file,
install the few plugins I use and voil&aacute;---it was done. It probably
took less than ten minutes (including reading the documentation).
