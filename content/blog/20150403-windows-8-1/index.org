I find the update process with Windows 8.1 somewhat annoying. 

It may be me. It may be the way I have it to update. Nevertheless, it seems like a high maintenance process (especially compared to FreeBSD). I seem to have to reboot my PC every week so it can complete the update process and the updates seem to take 5 minutes or so.

Compared to FreeBSD where one rarely needs to reboot (expect when moving between releases), and where updates merrily happen in the background, the update process in Windows 8 seems intrusive. This seems to be the case for many of the programmes associated with Windows. Adobe Flash, for example, it is cumbersome; I have lost track of the times I have 'accidentally' installed something else alongside the Flash update.

Consequently, I am thinking about dumping Windows 8.1 as my desktop and going back to a pure FreeBSD solution. Alas and alack, FreeBSD does not play well with Google Drive. That is the only thing holding me back.
