I've mentioned
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20040615-what-is-agency.md" >}})
Emirbayer & Minche's great article on agency.

In that article they refer to projects of action, and in particular
an piece by Alfred Schutz, namely:

> Schutz, A. (1962). Choosing among projects of action. In M. A.
Natanson (Ed.), _Collected papers: Volume 1, The problem of social reality_
(pp. 67---98). The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.

Here are my notes from that chapter

1. The concept of action
2. The time structure of the project
3. In-order-to and because motive
4. Fancying and projecting
5. The foundation of practicability
a) The world as taken for granted
b) The biographically determined situation
6. Doubting and questioning
7. The problematic and open possibilities according to Husserl
8. Choosing among objects within reach
9. Choosing among projects
10. Bergson's theory of choice
11. Leibniz's theory of volition
12. The problem of weight
13. Summary and conclusion
