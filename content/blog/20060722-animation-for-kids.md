It's going to be a busy weekend. We're seeing five movies over the
weekend. Today started off with more animation at the [film
festival](https://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz/).

The two best films were [Der
Propellervogel](https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0490473/) and
[Moongirl](https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0482549/). Kazkaheutte was pretty good
too. The audience (mainly children) seemed to enjoy them all (and enjoy them
immensely).
