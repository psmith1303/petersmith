For several years I've played a friendly game of squash with my brother every weekend. His children (Mac, Oscar, and Stevie) come along and play too (to a greater or smaller extent based on their ages). This week, for a change, I had a game with Lincoln Kyne. He is one of the MBA students. I was roundly thrashed.

Five games to nil, and I rarely got passed 3 points. I think it highlights:

- My general lack of fitness,
- A certain /malaise/ from playing the same person, and
- Lincoln's skill and energy.

Well I hope to have a few more games with him, and hopefully I be able to give him a better fight.

Nevertheless, it was good fun (but I bet I ache tomorrow).
