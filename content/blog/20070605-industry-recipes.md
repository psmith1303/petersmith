I was tracking down some information on methodology (in particular the work of
[J-C Spender](http://www.jcspender.com/) when I came across his web site.

It put me on to a good Org. Theory site, called (unsurprisingly)
[OrgTheory](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/)

Anyway, going back to John-Christopher, one of his best works is: 

> Spender, J.-C. (1989). _Industry recipes: An enquiry into the nature and sources of
managerial judgement_. Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell.

This book is no longer in print, but JC is distributing from his web site. It's
an absolute classic, so if you don't have a copy [download
one](http://www.jcspender.com/uploads/Industry_recipes.pdf). What I didn't know
is that the book was based on his PhD thesis; that must of been one outstanding
thesis.
