I'm using [[https://yihui.name/en/][Yihui Xie's]] most excellent [[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/][bookdown]] package to create my courseguide for [[https://www.courseguide.info/][BUSINESS 705]].

One problem I have is that I use SVG images. That's all well and good when I am rendering the courseguide as an HTML book, but when I try and produce a PDF, bookdown (well LaTeX) chokes. It's no one's fault really. It's just a fact of life.

So, I need to convert my SVG images into PDFs. That'll fix the problem.

The way I do it is

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

inkscape mygraph.svg --export-pdf=mygraph.pdf

#+END_SRC

Easy!

I then created a =Makefile= to cycle through all the SVGs in the =images= director and convert them. I'm not sure how smart the Makefile is, but it works.

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
#
# Convert the SVG files to PDFs
#

SVGFILES := $(wildcard *.svg)

all: $(SVGFILES:%.svg=%.pdf)

%.pdf : %.svg
    inkscape --export-pdf $*.pdf $*.svg

#+END_SRC
