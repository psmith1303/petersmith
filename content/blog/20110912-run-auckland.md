I never got around to completing my posts on RUN Auckland.

Overall, and despite only completing five out of the six races, I was fourth in
my age group. I regard that as quite an achievement since I've only really been
running a year. My times were:

- 00:48:32 -- Remuera
- 00:48:49 -- Te Atatu
- 00:47:59 -- Bucklands Beach
- 00:53:31 -- Northcote Point
- 00:46:47 -- Western Springs

A consistent result. The outlier is Northcote Point. My race [report on Daily
Mile](http://www.dailymile.com/people/PeterS6/entries/7395630) begins "Hills.
Need I say more".

That's one thing I need to continue to work on is my hill running.  Going up,
and going down. But to do it well I need to shed around about another 7 Kg and
get down to 70 Kg. Let's see if I can do that before the Auckland Marathon.
