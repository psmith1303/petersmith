I used to use ~Markdown~ a lot. But, increasingly, ~org-mode~ has taken over as my 'formatter' of choice (yes, formatter isn't the right word, but it will do here).

So, with this blog post, I am moving over to org-mode.

The big question that I have yet to answer is, "Should I move my old
posts from ~markdown~ to ~org-mode~ formatting? It would not be a
trivial task, even with some scripting. Let's see how it goes :)


As, something of a codicil, I also moved to the latest version of Hugo
(0.74.2). This necessitated me going through and fixing/updating some
of my templates around RSS handling and date formatting. Template
debugging is no fun.
