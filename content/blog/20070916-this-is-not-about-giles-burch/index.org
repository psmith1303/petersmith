This evening Lisa and I went to a diner party hosted by [[https://www.gilesburch.com][Giles Burch]] and Catherine. It was a most enjoyable evening.

Giles' parents were at the dinner too. As always, they were very convivial company. Afterwards, I thought I would [[https://www.google.com/][Google]] his father as he has a number of achievements to his name---but I came [[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4995430.html][up]] [[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5159744.html][somewhat]] [[https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050531/ai_n14648101][empty]].

I wonder if his generation is the last generation whose past won't be written indelibly on the web.
