Well despite the Palm problems of yesterday, I do seem to be making some good progress on my PhD proposal. I seem to have a research questions; and I think I know the method I will use. They are a little rough around the edge yet---but I hope to have something pretty concrete by the end of next week.

Had a lovely breakfast at Corsa in [[https://www.arc.govt.nz/volcanic/mteden.htm][Mt. Eden]]. The coffee was superb and the eggs Benedict was lovely. They use some wonderful honey cured bacon instead of ham. Yum.

Picked a couple of videos from [[https://www.videon.co.nz/][Mt. Eden]]. They are with out doubt the best video store in town. [[https://us.imdb.com/Title?0215750][Watched Enemy at the Gates]]. A solid ironing movie (something good enough to watch whilst ironing, but it doesn't require all of one's attention).
