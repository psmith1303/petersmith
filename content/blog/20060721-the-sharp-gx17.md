I've replaced my old phone. My [Nokia
6310](https://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,18177,00.html) has been retired.

I tend to only use my phone in the car (with a [Blue
Ant](https://www.blueant.com.au/) [car
kit](https://www.blueant.com.au/supertooth2.htm) but I've always wanted to use
the old Nokia with my laptop. Alas, the bluetooth implementation on the Nokia
seems to be a bit flaky to say the least.  Firmware upgrades, new PC software
had no effect; the connection to the PC was always difficult (aka impossible).

Everyone else around me seems to be getting new phones (and the [Motorola
Razr](https://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details/069,00.html) seems
particular popular), but all I want is a phone that does bluetooth well and
that I can _manage_ through my PC. I don't particular want a camera, play
games, download, ring-tones. Bluetooth is all I really need.

Anyway, I was passing [Cool Mobile](https://www.coolmobile.net.nz/) in the city
and went in and had a look at their parallel imported products. I was
pleasantly surprised to bump into a former MGMT 101 student working there. The
end result is that I've brought a Sharp GX17. Not a new model by any means. Not
G3. But I think it will do want I want it to do.

Being an impulse buyer, I didn't stop to check the price with
[Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.co.nz/). After the event I found I could get it
$20 cheaper through Vodafone. Que sera.
