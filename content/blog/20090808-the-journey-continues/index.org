A few people have noticed that I have lost some weight, and that's true.

I'm also getting a few questions about the how I did it ... so here it is.

{{< img src="psmith1303PhysicsDiet.png" title="Graphs of weighloss progress" >}}

I really only did did two things. First, I began tracking my weight daily on [[https://physicsdiet.com/][Physics Diet]]. Secondly, I everything that I ate through [[https://www.livestrong.com][Live Strong]] (and in particular the /Daily Plate/ function there). Putting my managerial hat on, I would say that we know "you get what you measure", and so I measured.

The background information that kept me on the straight and narrow came from [[https://www.fourmilab.ch/][John Walker's]] [[https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html][the hacker's diet]].

The result, so far, is I've lost about 20 Kg, and I think I have about another 10--15 Kg to go. That would put me bang in the middle of normal [[https://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/][body mass index]] range for my height. Having said that, the [[https://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.htm][people choice]] ideal weight for me would be about 77 Kg.

Anyway, the journey continues...
