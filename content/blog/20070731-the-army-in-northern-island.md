I note that, [according to the
BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6921702.stm).

> The British Army's emergency operation in Northern Ireland
comes to an end at midnight on Tuesday [tonight] after 38 years.
Operation Banner, as it was called, was the longest in the Army's
history.

No doubt, there will be much rejoicing in many quarters and the end of the need
for military support for what were called [the
    troubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_troubles).

That reminds me, I went to Beijing in 1994 and our Chinese guide would use the
phrase "and something happened" when talking (on not talking) about protests
and deaths that occurred in [Tiananmen
Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989).  At
the time I found the use of the expression "and something happened" somewhat
obtuse. But, in hindsight, the "sensibility' of saying "and something happened"
is no more strange than calling what went on in Northern Ireland "the
troubles".
