I've been looking at my ongoing run performance. In particular, I've been looking at how much (volume) of running I've done. The following graph shows my last three years of running, on a month-by-month basis.

It's quite interesting to see the peaks and troughs. You can generally see I've become more meticulous in tracking the type of run.

I thinking of using [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]] to get some [[https://flowingdata.com/2012/05/15/how-to-visualize-and-compare-distributions/%20%22How%20to%20vizualize%20and%20compare%20distributions%22][better]] (more interesting plots), but I'll have to export my data first from [[https://www.runningahead.com/logs/956b935fdb5b4c9ba0ab4fe2e45b5f01%20%22Running%20ahead%22][Running Ahead]] (which is where I track my running data, versus [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150728033016/https://www.dailymile.com/people/PeterSmith][Dailymile]] which is where I do my "social' side of running; for completeness, I use [[https://athlinks.com/][Athlinks]] to track my race results).
