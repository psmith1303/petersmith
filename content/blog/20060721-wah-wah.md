Still at the [festival](http://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz) ...  This movie is a
semi-autobiographical piece by [Richard E.
Grant](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001290/) recounts a his life in Swaziland.
Not only did he write the screen play, but he also produced and directed it.
Apparently, his real mother (played in the movie by [Miranda
Richardson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001669/)) thought is was a good movie
too (if I remember the [Five Live](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio5/) interview).
There is some really fine acting in this movie. I particular enjoyed seeing
[Emily Watson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001833/) as Ruby---but the whole
cast was pretty good.

Oddly, the cinematography of Swaziland (I think it was filmed
there) reminded me of the [Wairarapa](http://www.wairarapanz.com/) on a
hot summer's day. But then, I've often thought that the Wairarapa was
a bit like the African veld (and yes, I've never been to the African
veld, but I have been to the Wairarapa).

Overall, four out of five stars.
