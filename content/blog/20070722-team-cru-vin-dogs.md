I've spent a happy few hours this weekend putting together a website
for [Team Cru Vin Dogs](http://www.teamcruvindogs.com/). It's been a
nice distraction from writing (my PhD thesis).

The design work was done by Grant Hunter at [Hunter
Creative](http://www.huntercreative.co.nz/), and I assembled the
plumbing using:

- [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) as the CMS
- [A2](http://www.a2hosting.com) as the hosting company
- [Network Solutions](http://www.networksolutions.com/) for the domain name

It will be interesting to see how much financial support for
[Mobility Dogs](http://www.mobilitydogs.co.nz) will be generated;
after all that is the main purpose of the [Team Cru Vin
Dogs](http://www.teamcruvindogs.com/) site.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without the support
of [Cru Vin Dogs](http://www.cruvindogs.com) who are funding the racing
team.
