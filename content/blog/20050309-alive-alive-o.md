I had one of my regular meetings with Peter Boxall today to talk about my PhD
progress (he is my supervisor). After the meeting I met with Darl Kolb and we
went across to the little coffee shop known as Pod. As we walked across the
campus I was struck by how alive it seems at the moment. The new semester has
just begun[^1] and the place seems so buzzing. It's wonderful. I always miss
the way the University hums when the students aren't here.

[^1]: The semester actually started last week, but I was away at Rotorua doing
the residential week with the new intake of MBA students.
