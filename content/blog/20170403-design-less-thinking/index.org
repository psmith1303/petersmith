I found myself participating in a workshop on Friday based on the principles of 'design thinking'.

According to Wikipedia, design thinking:

> refers to creative strategies designers utilizer during the process
> of designing. Design thinking is also an approach that can be used
> to consider issues and resolve problems more broadly than within
> professional design practice, and has been applied in business and
> to social issues.

The process of design thinking is seen as a number of stages being:
Inspiration, ideation, and implementation.

The workshop I attended was lead by a couple of experienced IT folk
from IBM who have applied design thinking in a number of contexts.

The initial talk at the workshop was around design aesthetics and
elegance. However, the process driven approach to the
workshop---coupled with the fact that none of the participants
were/are designers meant that the solutions that were surfaced were
neither aesthetically pleasing, nor elegant. Indeed, given the
participants how could it have been any other way.
