I was at a seminar to day with Anne Huff when she mentioned an old article by
Murray Davis. We'll I'm always a sucker for a good reference, so I dutifully
went and had a look at
[Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=davis+%22that%27s+interesting%22).  The
[first](https://www.sfu.ca/\~palys/interest.htm) reference it through up (which
has a bit of summary of the article) provided enough information for me to get
a copy of the original article.  So these are my notes on the article. Oh, I
don't intended to summarise the article (what's the point of that), rather I
want to get my thoughts down as to how this article helps my thinking on
strategy-as-practice.

A theorist is considered great not because of the truth of falsity of what they
say, but because what they say is interesting. So this article seeks to
discover what is interesting. As an aside I recall that in other fields of
(positivist) research, greatness has been defined not so much by
interestingness but also by the elegance of the theory. I'm sure [David
Barry](https://www.geocities.com/drdavidbarry/) would have something to say here
about elegance and aesthetics.

Anyway, back to the article by Davis. What is particular interesting to me (and
here is the link to strategy-as-practice) is the idea that an interesting idea
is one that shows that "What seems to be assorted heterogeneous phenomena are
in reality composed of a single element" (Davis, 1971, p. 315). and that bq.
Many natural and social scientists have made their reputations by pointing out
that the appearance of a natural or social phenomena is an illusion and that
what the phenomenon really consists of lies "below' its surface. Their
"profound' insight is considered especially interesting when these theorists
also assert that the "fundamental' nature ("depth structure') of the phenomenon
contradicts the surface impression, as, for example the seemingly continuous
appearance of a table is contradicted by the discreet molecules of which it is
actually composed.

Much of the dialogue in the Strategy-as-practice arena is about the
relationship between the macro and the micro. And yet. And yet, I have never
really been convinced that such a distinction is warranted.  As yet, I don't
have much to support that---other ontological/epistemological stances such as
Garfinkle's ethnomethodology (1967) would adopt a similar stance to mine---but
I need to find a way to justify my position within my
ontological/epistemological stance.

Once the division between the micro and the macro is removed, then we can
concentrate on (and here I flip back into the "old' terminology) how the micro
impacts the macro.  To end with, I think this article is useful in
understanding why some articles really seem to work, whilst others just seem to
say nothing of-note.

_Abstract to Davis's _That's interesting__ 

> QUESTION: How do theories which are generally considered
> _interesting_ differ from theories which are generally considered
> _non-interesting_?

> ANSWER: Interesting theories are those which _deny_ certain
> assumptions of their audiences, while non interesting theories are
> those which _affirm_ certain interests of their audience. This
> answer was arrived at through the examination of a number of famous
> social, and especially sociological, theories. That examination also
> generated a systematic index of the variety of propositional firms
> which interesting and non-interesting theories may take. The
> fertility of this approach suggests a new field be established

> supplement the Sociology of Knowledge. This new field will be
> phenomenological orientated in so far as it will focus on the
> movement of the audience's mind from one accepted theory to another.
> It will be sociologically orientated in so far as it will focus in
> the dissimilar base-line theories of he various sociological
