Since [moving to
Zotero]({{< relref "20080920-moving-to-zotero.md" >}}),
I've found my "work flow' to be much smoother. These [few
tips](http://ideophone.org/12-zotero-tips-and-techniques/) have made
things even easier. I particularly find it useful when I've found a
link to the full-text of an article, just to drag the link to the item in
Zotero (and have Zotero auto-magically download into my library).
