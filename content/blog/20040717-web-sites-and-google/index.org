[[https://www.google.com/][Google]] still isn't crawling the site (much). I think part of the problem is that there are very few sites which link to this one. Besides [[https://thewoolseys.com/][The Woolseys]] and [[https://consulting.co.nz/][Consulting]], I can't find many sites that link here.

Oh well. I expect time will take care of that problem.
