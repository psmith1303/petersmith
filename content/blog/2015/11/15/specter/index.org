We went to see the latest James Bond movie today, Specter. Typical fare for a Bond movie. What made it different is that we saw it in our local Gold Class cinema. So we were getting food and drinks delivered to our lovely reclining chairs. It made it all quite fun.

The sliders where pretty nice. Very "code compliant". They tasted good and eating them did not cause a distraction for other patrons.
