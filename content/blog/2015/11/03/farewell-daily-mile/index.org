Since 2010 I have routinely posted details of my running on [[https://www.dailymile.com][Daily Mile]]. Through that site I have come into contact and made friends with many runners here in Auckland, throughout New Zealand, and across the world.

But for a while now, the site has been becoming moribund. Fewer and fewer people seem to be using it. Looking at the traffic to the site, it has been rapidly declining. More and more of the people I am interested in no longer post to Daily Mile.

So, today I closed my account. Instead, I am maintaining my running data on the most excellent [[https://www.smashrun.com/peter.smith/overview][SmashRun]], and for the social side of things I will use Facebook (for now).

How the world slowly morphs.
