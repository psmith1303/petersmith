#### Coffee shots
A single shot of coffee uses about 7.5 g of beans and produces about 30 ml of coffee (including the crema), with a double shot using  15g (or there abouts) of beans, giving 60 ml of coffee.

#### Coffee ratios
So, how much coffee to milk should I be using?

* Macchiato, one shot and a splash of milk
* Cortado is 1:1. For a single that's about 30 + 30 = 60ml. For a double that's 120ml
* Flat white is 1:4. For single that's 30 + 120 = 150ml, for a double that's 300ml
* Latte is 1:3. For a single, that's 30 + 90 = 120ml, and a double is 240ml.

#### Coffee glasses
We have three sizes of Duralex Picardie glasses that we use for coffee.

* 90ml (3 fl oz). These are good for espressos, macchiatos, or single cortados (60ml)
* 130ml (4.5 fl oz). Double cortado (120ml). Single latte (120ml)
* 160ml (5.5 fl oz). Single flat-white (150ml)
* 300ml (10 oz). Double flat-white (300ml). Double Latte (240 ml, that's  a good bit of room at the top).

Remember a cortado is stronger than a latte, and a latte is stronger than a flat-white.
