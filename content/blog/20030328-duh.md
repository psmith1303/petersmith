It's Moreno, not Monroe. I just got one of his books out of the
library. It's:

Moreno, J. L. (1978). _Who shall survive? Foundations of sociometry,
group psychotherapy, and sociodrama_ (3rd ed.). Beacon, NY: Beacon
House.

Quite a weighty tome; it's about 750 pages long, so it will take some
time to read. I'll try a leave notes hear about the interesting-bits.
