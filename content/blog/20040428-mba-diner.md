The [School of Business](http://business.auckland.ac.nz/) held a diner at the
[North Club](http://www.northernclub.co.nz/) in celebration of this years
completing MBAs (who graduate on Monday).  I was happy to be there, both as an
alum' of the program (MBA'95) and because I taught on the integrating strategy
course last year.  There were MBAs there from every year. Including two from
the first MBA program---MBA of 84.

[Rob McLeod](http://www.nzbr.org.nz/documents/releases/releases-2002/new_chairman.doc.htm)
was the major guest speaker. being rather right of centre, he did prompt some
interesting debate. In many ways, his address felt like the [Greed is
Good](http://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechwallstreet.html)
speech from [Wall Street](http://www.imdb.com/Title?0094291). I seem to recall,
that the speech was attributed to some executive who gave it to an MBA class in
the US. I'm not sure if it is true or not, but if it is true, it would be nice
to find the original speech.
