I've been doing a few more upgrades. The first one should allow me to
have a [WYSISG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG "Wikipedia link to
WYSIWYG")
editor.

So I should be able to do

1. **bold**  _italics_ <u>underline</u> and of course <strike>strikethrough</strike>,
2. Numbered outlines (obviously), and
3. Hyperlinks.

So far so good.
