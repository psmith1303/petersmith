For those who know me, it my come as a little surprise that I do some quantitative based research and that my weapon of choice is [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]].

Over the past couple of days, I have been analysing some data about the performance of students in courses. To start with, I have used correlations to get a feel for what relationships might exist.

I was having a problem with =corrplot= and =corrplot.mixed= and in working my way through the problem I came across this [[https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2014/08/05/a-visualization-error/][page]] by [[https://kieranhealy.org/][Kieran Healy]] and his paper on [[https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4203684][Data visualization in sociology]].

It was very helpful (and worth a read).

Anyway, here is one of my visualizations showing the correlations between the performance of a group of students between courses.

But there is a coincidence here. The template/design of this site +is+ was largely based on Kieran's own site; if you have followed the links in this post, I am sure you will see the similarities. Thanks Kieran!
