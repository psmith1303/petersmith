I've spent a happy few hours merging two weblogs together. At first I thought it would be as easy as [[https://www.phpmyadmin.net/][changing]] a few [[https://www.mysql.com/][SQL]] tables.

Alas, that is only half the job. There are also the categories that also need to be redone. Not a straight forward job. Perhaps I should have done some research first---but much of the fun is in finding out.

Anyway, it's done now, and everything seems to be working okay. If there are any problems particularly with entries from before 2004, please let me know.
