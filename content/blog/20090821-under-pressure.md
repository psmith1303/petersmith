Surprise, surprise, the doc says my blood pressure is now 110/75. It
hasn't been that low for several years. The doc thinks that my BP isn't
'bad' but could be lower. Okay, says I; I
think I can do that. Having lost 21Kg, I guess I just need to loose
another 14 or so (to get to my target of 70Kg).
