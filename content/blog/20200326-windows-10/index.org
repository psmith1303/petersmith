The part of the Business School I now work in seems to live and die by
meetings, and these meetings are organised using Outlook. I have been
using my trust Fastmail account, and whilst it's okay, the calendaring
functions (for people looking up my availability) are too messy---they
would all need to adjust their configuration.

So, I have bitten the bullet, drunk the Cool-Aide and installed Office
365, and to do that I had to install Windows 10 on my old Debian
laptop. Que sera. It's taken me about two weeks to get most things
sorted.

Still ...

... Outlook is a pig of a programme. It's bloated. It takes me loads
of keystrokes to do what would take me one in Fastmail. The only thing
that is worse that Outlook IMHO, is Sharepoint.

For the life of me, I can't figure out how to get Emacs to download my
calendar from Outlook (well Exchange) and put it in my org-mode
Agenda. Grrr.
