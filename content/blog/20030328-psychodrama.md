Well I've signed up for an introductory course (well they call it the _Core
curriculum_) in [psychodrama](http://www.psychodrama.org.nz).  It will be
interesting to see what happens.

I know relatively little about psychodrama, other than what I've
[read](http://www.users.on.net/\~iam/Pdis.html) and the fact that
Judith McMorland has demonstrated it a couple of times.

Any way the first class is to night, and continues tomorrow and
Sunday. There are four _experiential_ weekends like this through out
the year, plus a number of evening sessions.

There should be nine of us on the course (myself included), and out of
the nine the majority (7) are women. I wonder why that might be.

Really, I should spend sometime reading up on J. L. Monroe, who seems
to be the founder of the method. Surprisingly though, a quick search of
the Internet throws up nothing of use---there are just too many
Monroes out their.
