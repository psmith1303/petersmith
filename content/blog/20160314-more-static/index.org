I was kind of happy using Pelican to publish my (now static) website. However, the way I implemented meant that I actually had three separate 'websites' which where rather independent of one another.

My teaching portfolio looked like this:

{{< img src="2016portfolio.png" title="My teaching portfolio" >}}

Whereas my teaching journal (where I talk about teaching) looked like this:

{{< img src="2016journal.png" title="My journal" >}}

And finally, my little blog looked like this:

{{< img src="2016blog.png" title="My blog" >}}

It all worked, but having three sites seemed somewhat messy. I thought about integrating it all in one Pelican site/configuration. But, there were some things that I did not like. The main one is that Pelican is really a blogging platform more than anything else. Other types of data---publications---would need to be kludged in. So, I started to look for something else.

Having looked at a variety of static site generators, I decided that [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] could be a good choice. I then searched around for someone using it in a similar way to what I wanted; that how I came across the rather nice site of [[https://kieranhealy.org/][Kieran Healy]]. You can tell that I liked what he had done as I downloaded his git archive of his site and used it as the basis for this site.

There are still some things to do. For example, I need to add in my teaching portfolio and load-up all my (few) publications. But other than then small tasks like that, I think I ready to take the new site live.
