I've been exchanging a few emails with Richard
[Tisdall](https://www.tisdalls.co.nz/) regarding the "unreliable'
stepmeter, that I replaced. He has been concerned by the problem and
very helpful in dealing with it. People sometimes complain that
Kiwi's don't know how to _do_ customer service, but I think my
experiences with Tisdalls shows that some Kiwis give outstanding
customer service.

One think I recall from marketing (many years ago) is that people are
more likely to tell others of a bad experience, than a good one. So,
let be unequivocal when I say, I have received excellent service from
Tisdalls, and I always recommend them when people ask me about
pedometers (I think they have had a half-dozen people buying them as
a result of my comments). I'll certainly be shopping there again.
_Tisdalls are my shop of the year_
