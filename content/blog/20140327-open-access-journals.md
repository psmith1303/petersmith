With the increasing emphasis globally on Open Access journals, talking
with [Lisa
Callagher](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/l-callagher) has
left me wondering "Where is the budget for getting oneself published in
an OA journal?" After all, they don't come cheap---they can be as much as
$3,000 per article.
