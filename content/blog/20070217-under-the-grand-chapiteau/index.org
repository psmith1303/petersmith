We went and saw Cirque du Soleil. Actually, there were quite a few of us from the University who went. It's nice to get out as a bit of a group.

What did I enjoy the most---the people on the swings at the end. I do enjoy flying through the air myself, and I'd really like to try those swings.

Lisa asked if anyone has written a case on Cirque du Soliel. I'm aware of one in:

And I think Yvon Dufour (who is about to join the Business School) has also worked with them.
