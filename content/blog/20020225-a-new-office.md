I spent part of the morning doing research. The end result---I've have
a dozen books from the library, on business simulations. _That
should keep me busy for the rest of the week_.

The new PhD coordinator, Erling called a meeting to find out what we
(the PhD cohort) wanted to do during this year. It seems that there
will be three main programs.

- A series of writing retreats---the last one was so good, this was
 first on our list
- A series of workshops covering things like
 [EndNote](https://www.isiresearchsoft.com/). I might be roped into
 delivering that one in particular.
- PhD seminars/get togethers/social event, every six weeks-or-so.
- Presenting seminars by the PhD cohort to the department (for
 friendly feedback)

I really like the sound of the program---there is certainly a lot
being done for us.

Had a mad rush over to the Takapuna/North Shore campus. It's
pandemonium as the builders try and finish things for the new
semester next Monday.

Anyway, they have more or less finished extending my office, so I
spent several hours getting everything back into place, sorting out
furniture and books, getting rid of the dust. Well, its done now. I
only hope it isn't necessary for them to fit in another person---that
will be a squeeze.

Of course, there is only a room shortage until the new offices are
built on the third floor. Who knows when that will happen. I guess it
depends on when the existing tenants leave.
