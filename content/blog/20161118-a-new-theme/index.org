My Hugo original theme was based on the work of [[https://kieranhealy.org/][Kieran Healy]], and it looked very much luck this:

Any how, I figure it was time to rework things. So, based a bit of looking around at what other folk have been doing, and then adding in some sauce, I came up with this, responsive, mobile-first theme.

Maybe they still look similar, but I kinda like my version.

In doing so, I simplified my templates quite a bit. The resulting theme is probably not rock solid, but it is available on [[https://github.com/psmith1303/hugo-news][GitHub]].
