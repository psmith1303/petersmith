I have a large number of documents that I need to "re-style' before I
import them into [nVivo](http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx).
 I can import the necessary style into each document one-by-one, but I've
been looking for a way to apply styles across multiple files (either
all at once, or automatically/programmatically).

As I trawled the web looking for a solution, I can across this amusing
[rant](http://www.goodiebag.tv/episodes/06_trajan_is_the_movie_font.htm)
against the font
[Trajan](http://www.linotype.com/8565/trajanregular-font.html). Indeed, there
is an entire website devoted to [retiring Trajan](http://www.retiretrajan.com/)
