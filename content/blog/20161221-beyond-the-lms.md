As I think about my teaching for next year, what kind of relationship
do I want with my students. The fact that I even ask such a question
suggests that I do want some kind of relationship, rather than a more
"at arms' length" association.

So, within our institutional framework, how do I foster a good
relationship. For many, the primary point of contact with
students---outside of the classroom---is through Canvas (the
University's LMS ... learning management system). I have been thinking
how to organise my course within Canvas to support/build a
relationship with students, but, alas Canvas as we currently use it
doesn't seem to be up to the job.

The more I think about it, the less I think I need Canvas as my point
of contact with students. If I want a relationship with students,
something dialogue based, then the use of something centralised, like
Canvas, seems like a mis-fit. What I need is something that better
supports a dialogue. Something like ...

Email, twitter, etc. Something that is inherently two-way in nature.

What would this look like? Well it would be more event driven. I
imagine something based around the following four events (in no particular order):

1. Student enrols in the course
2. Student un-enrols in the course
3. Student is allocated grades/marks for an assignment
4. Student completes the course.

For each of these events I could generate the appropriate email:

1. Enrolment -- pack of information about the course, any needed
   content, calendar (ICS) information, etc.
2. Un-enrolment -- thanks and a request for 'diagnostic' information
   as to why they unenrolled.
3. Grade allocation: Details of the grade, personalised feedback on
   the assessment, details of their standing in the class as a result
   of the assessment (e.g., a summary of their grades), some guidance
   for their overall improvement, etc.
4. Completion: Final grades, ranking within class, course evaluation etc.

I think that would work. What do you think?
