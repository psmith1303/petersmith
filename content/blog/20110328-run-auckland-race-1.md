Well, yesterday was the first of the Run Auckland series at
[Waiatarua](http://maps.google.com/?q=http://share.abvio.com/4df8/7197/4cb5/61b3/Runmeter-Run-20110327-0857.kml).
And I'm pretty pleased with my results.

I'm particularly happy about my relative place ... even if my pace
wasn't red hot.
