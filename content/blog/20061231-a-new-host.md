For many years I've run my own host for this website. Well no more. I'm now
using those nice people at [A2 Hosting](http://www.a2hosting.com/).  I was put
on to them by Merlin at [43Folders](http://43folders.com/).

So, far so good. They've been very responsive (every time I wanted a new Perl
module added, etc). The only problem I'm having at the moment is getting
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) working (as the don't support
mod_python).

Consequently, I've abandoned my implementation of
[GTD](http://www.davidco.com/) and started to use
[Tracks](http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/) which is a [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) implementation. I don't know Ruby (and I
don't really have time to learn it), but [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/)
is well supported by [A2 Hosting](http://www.a2hosting.co.nz/).
