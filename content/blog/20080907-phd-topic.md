It seems that I haven't addressed the issue of my PhD Topic anywhere on
this blog, So ... as I say in my thesis:

> The question that I seek to answer is "What is the nature of
> effective strategising in professional service firms?"
> 
> This question contains two parts:
>
> 1. How do strategy practitioners in professional service firms
>    'strategise'? What is the nature of their praxis (i.e. the formal and
>    informal day-to-day activities in which they engage when
>    strategising)?
> 2. How do strategists in a professional service firm have impact
>    beyond themselves; what characterises the praxis of those whose
>    strategising is consequential and thus strategic?

These questions come out from my long-term interest in both
strategy and professional service firms.

Whilst I focus on engineering consultancies in my thesis, I have
also carried out research in the context of accounting firms and
law-firms.
