Amongst the stream of articles that turn up through my [RSS
reader](https://www.google.co.nz/reader) was one for pulled pork, aka [cochinita
pibil](https://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cochinita_pibil/).  [Eric
Guthey](https://uk.cbs.dk/degree_programmes/cbs_graduate_school/kandidatuddannelser/leadership_and_management_studies/menu/faculty_staff/faculty_staff/line_coordinator/eric_guthey)
had told me how great pulled pork could be, so I thought "why not?".  So, off
to [Mexican Specialties](https://www.mexicanspecialities.co.nz/) for some and 24
hours later I had some of the most delicious pork ever.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I should say that my darling wife made some picked red onions to go with the
pork. It was the perfect accompaniment.
