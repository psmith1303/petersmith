I try to be active in the
[strategy-as-practice](https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/) community.  One of
the ways I do this is by maintaining a bibliography of readings that is
available through the [web-site](https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/). A few
weeks ago, I asked people for any suggestions to add to the bibliography.
[Gerry Johnson](https://www.strath.ac.uk/gsb/staff/johnson_g.html) sent me a
list he has been working on with
[Leif](https://www.ihh.hj.se/eng/research/emm_faculty/emm_leif_melin.htm)
[Melin](https://www.ihh.hj.se/info/nyheter/2003/2003_06_19_leifmelin.htm).  I've
start to work through the list, getting copies of the articles and reading
them, as I add them to the bibliography. The first article is:

> Langley, A. (1990). Patterns in the use of formal analysis in
strategic decisions. _Organization Studies, 11_(1), 17--45.

The abstract says:

> An empirical study examined how formal analysis is used in
strategic decision making in 3 organizations of different structural types.
In-depth investigation was made of the role of formal analysis at top levels in
3 organizations---a machine bureaucracy, a professional bureaucracy, and an
adhocracy. It was found that formal analysis is used for a variety of purposes
in organizations, and the way in which it is used varies from organization to
organization. Three patterns of use were identified: 1. Analysis is used for
substantive input to decisions, to control implementation, and to ensure
convergence toward action. 2. Analysis becomes a key tool of persuasion and
verification in the negotiation process between levels of the hierarchy
concerning actions to be taken. 3. Analysis appears unproductive as people use
it to put forward contradictory positions and to gain time in an atmosphere of
indecision and divergence. This suggests that organizational structure is a key
factor affecting the decision process.

There are a number of things that stand out after reading this article.
Firstly, it reminds me that formal analysis is more prevalent in the later
stages on strategising, e.g. in the evaluation of strategies or in filling in
the details---maybe through into implementation, rather than in the earlier,
dare I say more intuitive, formulation stages. I expect this is due the greater
reliance on creativity in the 'earlier' part of strategising.  Secondly, the
nature or configuration (e.g. Mintzberg, 1983) of the firm---in a structural
sense---impacts the ways in which formal (and informal) analysis is used. I
think this can be linked to [Ranson, Hinings, &
Greenwood's]({{< relref "20040412-the-structuring-of-organizational-structures.md" >}})
(1980) idea that structure and the way the organisation things are intertwined
(the archetype as they call it)---although that explicit link is not made in
the article.

Finally, it reminds me that I have to get around to reading Linblom's classic
1959 article on _muddling through_.
