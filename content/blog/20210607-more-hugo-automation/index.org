I publish my blog via [[https://github.com]] and [[https://app.netlify.com/][Netlify]]. I've been using [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] to do the heavy lifting of getting my stuff off my PC and onto github. But it's a bit tidious. I really want one command to do it all.

So, I started off with an elisp function

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (setq hugo-base-dir (concat ps-2nd-home-dir "Code/Websites-source/petersmith/")
	hugo-buffer "*hugo*")

  (defun hugo-publish ()
    (interactive)
    (setq ps/commit-message (read-from-minibuffer "Commit message: "))
    (let* ((default-directory (concat (expand-file-name hugo-base-dir) "/")))
      (when (call-process "bash" nil hugo-buffer t  "-c" (concat "./Commit.sh " ps/commit-message))
	(message "Blog published"))))

#+END_SRC

which calls my shell script ~Commit.sh~


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
#
DESCRIPTION="${@:-"A new post"}"

echo "The commit message is:    " \"${DESCRIPTION}\"
echo "The working directory is :" `pwd`

git add . &&  \
git add -u && \
git commit -m "${DESCRIPTION}" && \
git push origin master
#+END_SRC

That hardest part was escaping the ~DESCRIPTION~ variable.
