Well, I was wrong. [Kill Bill: Volume 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/)
isn't on here yet. So instead we went and saw [Starsky &
Hutch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335438/).  Nice touch having [David
Soul](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815800/) and [Paul Michael
Glaser](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001274/) make cameo appearances.

I didn't recognise [Juliette Lewis](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000496/) (who
played Kitty) until I saw the end credits.

Huggy Bear was played by Snoop Dogg (is that how you spell it?). Not
the greatest of actors.

All in all, I'd give the movie a thumbs up---well worth a trip to the
video store (or the cinema).
