The first film of the [film festival](https://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz/) (for me
any way) was _Animation Now_; a collection of "animated gems"[^1]. I agree with
someone else who was there, who said it wasn't as good as last year.

Nevertheless, there was some good material. The best of the collection were:

- _McLaren's Negatives_: I liked this as it gave me a better insight into how some forms of animation are done
- _Son of Satan_: I bet those who confused this with _Animation for Kids_ regretted it. An interesting exposition of violence.
- _The True Story of Sawney Beane_: A lovely Scottish tail of cannibals.
- _At the Quinte Hotel_: After all, _I am a sensitive man_ as Al Purdy puts it.

Although judging by the applause, the audience also liked _In My Day_ The film
_The Man of the Hour_ started of really well and then lost the plot (well, lost
me anyway).

All in all, well worth seeing.
