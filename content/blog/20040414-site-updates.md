I've made a couple of changes to the site. Firstly, on [The reflective
practitioner](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org), I've arranged to
display links to the first few new comments that have been made. This can be
seen on the left hand side of the main
[site](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org). I've also changed the way
entries from the individual blogs are aggregated and presented on the main
site---this will hide some of my longer (and more tedious) entries.

On my own site, [Post Script](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/ps/),
I've changed the templates so that a word count is displayed for each
entry---this also happens on the main
[site](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org) too.  By the way, if your blog
is hosted here and you see a blog style elsewhere that you like (e.g. at
[Movablestyle](http://www.movablestyle.com/)) let me know, and I'll change your
site too (if you can't do it yourself)).
