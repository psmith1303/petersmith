I've been doing a few more upgrades. The first one should allow me to have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG][WYSISG]] editor.

So I should be able to do

1. *bold* /italics/ underline and of course +strikethrough+,
2. Numbered outlines (obviously), and
3. Hyperlinks.

So far so good.

Of course, this is kind of redundant now that I am using Orgmode to format my documents.
