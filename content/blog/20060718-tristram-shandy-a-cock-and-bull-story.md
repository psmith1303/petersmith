I haven't read the [book](https://www1.gifu-u.ac.jp/\~masaru/TS/contents.html)
so I can't make any comment about the accuracy of this movie. What I can
comment on is how much I enjoyed it; and enjoy it I did.

I know that [Mark
Kermode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/entertainment/kermode.shtml) like the
movie (I listend to the
[podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/fivelive_aod.shtml?fivelive/kermode140706))
so I was expecting a good movie, and I was not disappointed. This movie will be
one for my DVD collection.

The cast was impressive. There were so many names and faces that I recognised
from elsewhere. The lead characters [Steve
Coogan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176869/) and [Rod
Brydon](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117339/) were very funny. There impressions
of [Al Pacino](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/) had me laughing so much I
though I was going to hurt myself.

Given the very English cast, this is a [BBC
movie](https://www.tristramshandymovie.com/) after all, I was surprised to see
[Gillian Anderson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000096/) in something more than
a cameo role.

Overall, 4 stars out-of-5.
