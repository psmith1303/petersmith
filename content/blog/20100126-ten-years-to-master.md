In an interesting post by [Peter Norvig
says](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) talks about how long it takes to
develop expertise. I've somewhat quoted him here; with a few tweaks to
the contemporary references.

> Researchers (Bloom & Sosniak, 1985; Bryan & Harter, 1899; Hayes,
> 1981; Simmon & Chase,1973) have shown it takes about ten years to
> develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess
> playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano
> playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and
> topology. The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again
> and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond
> your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while
> and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And
> repeat again.

> There appear to be no real shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical
> prodigy at age 4, took 13 more years before he began to produce
> world-class music. In another genre, the Beatles seemed to burst
> onto the scene with a string of \#1 hits and an appearance on the Ed
> Sullivan show in 1964. But they had been playing small clubs in
> Liverpool and Hamburg since 1957, and while they had mass appeal
> early on, their first great critical success, Sgt. Peppers, was
> released in 1967. Malcolm Gladwell (2009) reports that a study of
> students at the Berlin Academy of Music compared the top, middle,
> and bottom third of the class and asked them how much they had
> practised:

>> Everyone, from all three groups, started playing at roughly the same 
>> time - around the age of five. In those first few years, everyone
>> practised roughly the same amount - about two or three hours a week.
>> But around the age of eight real differences started to emerge.  The
>> students who would end up as the best in their class began to
>> practise more than everyone else: six hours a week by age nine,
>> eight by age 12, 16 a week by age 14, and up and up, until by the
>> age of 20 they were practising well over 30 hours a week. By the age
>> of 20, the elite performers had all totalled 10,000 hours of
>> practice over the course of their lives. The merely good students
>> had totalled, by contrast, 8,000 hours, and the future music
>> teachers just over 4,000 hours.
>
> So it may be that 10,000 hours, not 10 years, is the magic number.
> Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) thought it took longer: "Excellence in any
> department can be attained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not
> to be purchased at a lesser price." And Chaucer (1340-1400) complained
> "the lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne." Hippocrates (c.  400BC)
> is known for the excerpt "ars longa, vita brevis", which is part of
> the longer quotation "Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps,
> experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile", which in English
> renders as "Life is short, [the] craft long, opportunity fleeting,
> experiment treacherous, judgment difficult." Although in Latin, ars
> can mean either art or craft, in the original Greek the word "techne"
> can only mean "skill", not "art".
