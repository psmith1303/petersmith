I should start by saying (no pun intended) that I was already warm to
the idea of global warming. So, this film (docco) about [Al
Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore) and his crusade to inform
the world about global warming fell on fertile soil. Judging by the
applause at the end of the movie, most of the audience were also
"converts' (or had their opinions re-enforced).

Al comes across as an excellent speaker (and would you expect
anything less of a presidential candidate) and someone who is
passionate about the topic. He's also a Mac user---perhaps that's why
he never got into the Whitehouse.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. Overall, 3 out of 5 stars.
Having said that, it was emotionally laden and I know that I (and
others) would have liked a bit more science and perhaps a bit more of
a debate---but then again it didn't really set out to be an unbiased
discussion of the issue.

Despite my average rating, I do think that this move is an
important work and probably should be seen.
