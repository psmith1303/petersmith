This was the last file that we sent to see at the [film
festival](http://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz/). Maybe I don't _get_ French comedy,
but I found the end of this film incompressible. It started off with a good
premise, and some interesting ideas, but overall it is a stinker.I'll give it
one star out of-five.
