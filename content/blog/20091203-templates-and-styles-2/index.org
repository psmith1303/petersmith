It seems that I don't really understand the way that [Movable
Type](https://www.movabletype.com) handles styles and templates. I've
(yet again) made a total mess of this site in the process of setting up
my [academic journalling](/journal/).

No doubt this will take me sometime (over the weekend) to sort out ...
but I might wait until after the 8th December 2009, when [Movable Type
version 5 comes out](https://www.movabletype.org/2009/11/mt5_status.html).

I do like the approach taken by the [Ministry of Type](https://ministryoftype.co.uk/). 
When I redo my own style sheet, I'll have to bear in mind some 
of the principles that are evident on that elegant site.
