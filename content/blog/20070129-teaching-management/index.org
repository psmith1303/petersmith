I'm a little old fashioned. Aside from keeping up with things using RSS, I also subscribe to a number of mailing lists. One of them mentioned a book, namely:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Clawson, J. G., & Haskins, M. E. (2006). /Teaching management: A field guide for professors, corporate trainers and consultants/. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

#+END_QUOTE

/What a great read/. This has to be one of the best (and most practical) books on teaching I have read. There will be a lot I take back to teaching (when I get back into the classroom in 2008).
