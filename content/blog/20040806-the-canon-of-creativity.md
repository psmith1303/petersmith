I've another psychodrama workshop tomorrow. They seem to be coming thick and
fast at the moment. Tomorrow we are focusing on the _Canon of creativity_. Just
to warm myself up to the work, I thought I'd spend a few moments reading and
thinking about it.

This is very briefly talked about in

> Moreno, J. L. (1955). Canon of creativity: Analysis of the
creativity chart. _Sociometry, 18_(4), 103---104.

and is shown diagrammatically as:

I hope to fill in the detail of what this all means after the course.
This diagram represents the interplay between the _cultural
conserve_ and _spontaneity_ (that's awfully like the interplay
between the forces of institutionalism / habitus / etc. and
individual agency).

For Moreno, the _cultural conserve_ are the routinised patterns of behaviours,
especially in a group, that provide a sense of stability. Of course the problem
with this is that the way in which we respond to new situations, aka
spontaneity, is thus limited by our reliance on these ingrained patterns of
response.

If I learnt anything over the weekend it is the way in which one becomes
unsettled as tentatively attempts are made to break out of the cultural
conserve (what was referred to as cracking, but I think that is a local term).
