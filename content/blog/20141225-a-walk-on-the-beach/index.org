It's Christmas Day, and as usual, Lisa and I went for a beach walk. Just a short one; along Mission Bay Kohimaramara, and back. 

We met Charlotta W., her husband and some friends from Sweden who are visiting.

Weather-wise it is one of the nicer Christmas Days. I recall a few years ago, walking along Kohi' beach; it was blowing a gale and there were probably only four other people there. Not like today. It was relatively packed (for New Zealand).
