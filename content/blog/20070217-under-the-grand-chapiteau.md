We went and saw Cirque du Soleil. Actually, there were quite a few of
us from the University who went. It's nice to get out as a bit of a
group.

What did I enjoy the most---the people on the swings at the end. I do
enjoy flying through the air myself, and I'd really like to try those
swings.

Lisa asked if anyone has written a case on Cirque du Soliel. I'm
aware of one in:

> De Wit, B., <span class="amp">&</span> Meyer, R. (1998).
_Strategy process, content, context: An international perspective (2nd ed.)_.
Minneapolis, MN: Thompson Learning.

And I think Yvon Dufour (who is about to join the Business School) has
also worked with them.
