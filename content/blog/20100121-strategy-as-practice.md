I'm stepping down as the bibliographer of the [strategy-as-practice
website](https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/). That site is going
through a redesign, and as part of that, the team is considering
how/what to do with the bibliography.

My own view is that a social bibliography, such as
[mine](https://www.citeulike.org/user/psmith) might be more useful than a
stand alone bibliographic silo.

As many people know, I keep 
[my bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/petersmith/items) in
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Zotero also does community base
groups too, such as this one on 
[strategy as practice](https://www.zotero.org/groups/strategy_as_practce/items)
