It seems that the [UoA](http://www.auckland.ac.nz) has moved its
student email services over to [Google's](http://www.google.com/)
[gmail](http://www.gmail.com/) service.

This means that all the old address (UPI@ec.auckland.ac.nz) will move to the new
domain aucklanduni.ac.nz. No doubt this has been done to ease the
redirection of mail, but it does complicate searching from mail
from the university---I used to just use site:auckland.ac.nz to get
all UoA mail, but now that is broken.

Setting up Outlook to access gmail was relatively painless,
except:

1. The instructions assumed a gmail addresses, e.g. UPI@googlemail.com,
rather than UPI@aucklanduni.ac.nz, and
2. The SSL settings aren't fully specified
in the instructions.

Aside from that, it was plain sailing.
As an aside, I wonder how long it will be fore some spammer tries to
send mail to upi@aucklanduni.ac.nz
