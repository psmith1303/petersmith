Well it seems that my
[upgrade]({{< relref "20080806-yet-another-upgrade.md" >}})
of [Movable Type](https://www.movabletype.com/) didn't go as smoothly as
I thought.

Having moved to version 4.1, I rapidly, and too hastily moved to
4.2.

Unfortunately, I didn't test things properly and I only realised a
few days ago that all my old templates and style sheets were broken.
The "solution" I found on the web, of "refreshing' the templates,
actually installed new templates over the top of the old ones. Not
quite what I had in mind.

So, I'm now redesigning/rebuilding new templates ... so the site may not
be too pretty for awhile.
