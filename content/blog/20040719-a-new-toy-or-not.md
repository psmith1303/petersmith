During lunch, I walked down to Tisdall's and brought a new
[pedometer](http://www.silva.se/outdoor/products/acce_pedstep.htm). I lost mine
yesterday somewhere in between going in to School to watch the [BCG
case](http://www.bostonconsulting.com.au/chapterstarters/strategy.html) teams
present. I do like to know that I'm getting [enough
"peds]({{< relref "20040616-walking.md" >}})
in. Any it's lost, so I brought a new one...  I'm still sticking with the
[Silva](http://www.silva.se/) brand. They (Lisa's used them before) are pretty
reliable. If they have one problem, it's that they can fall off your belt when
getting into a car (or similar). I think that's what happened to my old one.
So, I'll be getting my toolbox out and making a few modifications to this one.

So, the steps keep racking up.
