As often happens, I'm looking at this as an opportunity for
learning. So, I'd like to pose a few questions to the author of the
_Reciprocal business_ email. The purpose of the questions are
two-fold. Firstly, it helps me understand what the author is thinking,
and secondly it forces the author to clarify their own thinking.

So, I wonder:

- What does _reciprocal business_ mean to you?
- What do you think it meant to the CE (and
others in that organisation)?
- Do you think the term _reciprocal business_ is widely used (and
understood) in New Zealand (especially when compared to the
rest of the world)?
- What do you expect will happen when you met the 
CEO and what do you think will happen?

I look forward to your comments and reflections.
