I have some fun working out my [[https://genes.petersmith.org/][genealogy]]. So far, I'm back to about 1812. But after that date it gets a little tricky.

The problem is that census data pre-1841 isn't very helpful (genealogically speaking), and prior to 1937 the birth, marriages, deaths indexes weren't centralised.

So, if I'm to go any further back, I'll need to get creative.
