I do enjoy podcasts. One of the best ones I've found is done by the folks at
[Manager Toos](http://www.manager-tools.com/). Their podcasts provide a wide
range of behaviours that managers can implement to improve their effectiveness
(and efficiency).

If you want to be a better manager---and you want to improve in bite
size pieces, then _Manager Tools_ could be the site for-you.
