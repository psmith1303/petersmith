I spent quite a bit of time today setting up the-site.

Of course, not knowing much about
[Zope](http://web.archive.org/web/20020510162004/http://www.zope.org/)
slowed me down a bit.

Nevertheless, it is working. I've used a bit of code for the [LUF
Content Management
System](http://www.zope.org/Members/regebro/luf_cms). No doubt,
[Regebro](http://regebro.wordpress.com), who wrote LUF, will also
recognise the style of the site too.
