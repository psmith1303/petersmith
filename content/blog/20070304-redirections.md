In moving this site to its new host at [A2](http://www.a2hosting.com/), I set
up [MovableType](http://www.sixapart.com/) slightly differently. This meant
that many of my old links into and out of the site didn't work any more.

So, I've spent a little time setting up some mod_rewrite rules (Thanks
[Mike](http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showthread.php?t=3925)) and tweaking
the configuration.  
 
So, hopefully there will be no more 404 Page Not Found errors.
