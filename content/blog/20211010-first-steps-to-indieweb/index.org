I stumbled across [[https://aaronparecki.com/ ][Aaron Parecki's]] website, and it got me thinking about [[https://indieweb.org/][Indieweb]] and how I might implement it.

So I've started to make some changes to my [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] theme in anticipation of doing that (and of adding the ability to do micro-publishing).

Now, I really need to get [[https://webmention.io/][webmention]] working, which I've started by following [[https://anaulin.org/blog/adding-webmentions/][Ana Ulin's instructions]]. As a test, I will try mentioning myself on [[https://petersmith.org/blog/2021/10/07/first-steps-to-indieweb/][this page]].
