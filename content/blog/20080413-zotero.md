Last year I had a little play with [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) the
bibliographic add-on for Firefox.. Whilst it worked pretty well, the
integration with Word was a little flakey, so I didn't adopt the
programme.

I've been trying it out again, and I'm really impressed. I exported
all my references from [EndNote](http://www.endnote.com) and gave it a
pretty solid workout. It's good. It's very good.
