I was a little surprised to see in my inbox an email entitled _Your 2014 year
in blogging \[petersmith.org\]_. On reading the email, its a summary of
activity on my (now former) WordPress blog. Given that I was self-hosting that
site (i.e., I had installed WordPress on my own server), I was taken aback that
WordPress seemed to have been reading my 'data'.

Actually, it's not clear if the email is really coming from WordPress or from
Jetpack. Then again, a quick Google reveals that Jetpack is produced by
WordPress. So, either way, it came from WordPress.

I never realised that my stats were being harvested by WordPress. Indeed, I should expect that
any online service I'm using (e.g., Dailymile) is harvesting my data. But, as I said,
I had a stand-alone WordPress installation. 

Part of the purpose of the email (and the report that comes with it), seems to
be the encouragement of bloggers to blog more. A quick skim of posts (again
through Google) indicates that this particular email campaign is successful.
There are plenty of bloggers saying they will be blogging more ... or as one
person said  #KeepOnBlogging.

All in all, this event makes me feel more comfortable about my switch to
Pelican for my blogs. I pretty sure that my stats won't be being fed back to
any central Python repository :)
