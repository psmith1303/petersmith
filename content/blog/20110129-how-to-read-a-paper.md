[Ben Goldacre](http://www.badscience.net/about-dr-ben-goldacre/) is one
of my favourite journalists. Over the years I've particularly enjoyed
his "debunking" of [Gillian
McKeith](http://www.badscience.net/2007/02/ms-gillian-mckeith-banned-from-calling-herself-a-doctor/).

Anyway, his latest column is a lovely read on [how to read a
paper](http://www.badscience.net/2011/01/how-to-read-a-paper/).

I thoroughly recommend getting his [RSS feed](http://www.badscience.net/feed/).
