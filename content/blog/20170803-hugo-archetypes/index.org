I missed some changes in Hugo ... and my archetype =archetypes/blog.md= was broken, so I amended it to this, and it seems to be working again.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

title = "{{ replace .TranslationBaseName "-" " " | title }}"
date = {{ .Date }}
draft = "False"
categories = [
        "Jottings",
        "Blogging",
        "The Arts",
        "Out and about",
        "Running",
        "Fitness",
        "Learning",
        "Teaching",
        "Case teaching",
        "Plagiarism",
        "Research",
        "Writing",
        "Data analysis",
        "Productivity",
        "IT",
        "Technology"
        ]

As I'm now using a bit of elisp and Orgmode to create new hugo entries, I'm deleting =blog.md= now.
