A few people have noticed that I have lost some weight, and that's
true.

I'm also getting a few questions about the how I did it ... so
here it is.

I really only did did two things. First, I began tracking my weight
daily on [Physics Diet](http://physicsdiet.com/). Secondly, I
everything that I ate through [Live Strong](http://www.livestrong.com)
(and in particular the _Daily Plate_ function there). Putting my
managerial hat on, I would say that we know "you get what you
measure", and so I measured.

The background information that kept me on the straight and narrow
came from [John Walker's](http://www.fourmilab.ch/) [the hacker's
diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html).

The result, so far, is I've lost about 20 Kg, and I think I have about
another 10--15 Kg to go. That would put me bang in the middle of
normal [body mass index](http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/) range
for my height. Having said that, the [people
choice](http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.htm) ideal weight for me
would be about 77 Kg.

Anyway, the journey continues...
