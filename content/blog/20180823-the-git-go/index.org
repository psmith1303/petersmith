I use `git` a bit. 

My main use is around pushing stuff to either
[Github](https://github.com) or to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com);
either as an intermediary for publishing stuff via
[Netliy](https://netlify.com) or because I'm actually sharing stuff/code with other folk.

And I use poorly.

So I was really pleased to come across this diagram from [Oliver
Steele](https://blog.osteele.com/2008/05/my-git-workflow/) which made
things much clearer to me.

And now back to work.
