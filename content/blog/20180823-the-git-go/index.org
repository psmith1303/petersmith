I use =git= a bit.

My main use is around pushing stuff to either [[https://github.com][Github]] or to [[https://bitbucket.com][Bitbucket]]; either as an intermediary for publishing stuff via [[https://netlify.com][Netliy]] or because I'm actually sharing stuff/code with other folk.

And I use poorly.

So I was really pleased to come across this diagram from [[https://blog.osteele.com/2008/05/my-git-workflow/][Oliver Steele]] which made things much clearer to me.

And now back to work.
