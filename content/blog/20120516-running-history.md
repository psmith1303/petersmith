I've been looking at my ongoing run performance. In particular, I've
been looking at how much (volume) of running I've done. The following
graph shows my last three years of running, on a month-by-month basis.

graph](https://www.runningahead.com/logs/956b935fdb5b4c9ba0ab4fe2e45b5f01/tools/graph?e10=10&e12=43&zsm=12&zdg=3&x=12&y=20&t=0)

It's quite interesting to see the peaks and troughs. You can generally
see I've become more meticulous in tracking the type of run.

I thinking of using [R](https://www.r-project.org/ "The R project") to get some
[better](https://flowingdata.com/2012/05/15/how-to-visualize-and-compare-distributions/
"How to vizualize and compare distributions") (more interesting plots), but
I'll have to export my data first from [Running
Ahead](https://www.runningahead.com/logs/956b935fdb5b4c9ba0ab4fe2e45b5f01
"Running ahead") (which is where I track my running data, versus
[Dailymile](https://web.archive.org/web/20150728033016/https://www.dailymile.com/people/PeterSmith "Peter Smith on Daily
Mile") which is where I do my "social' side of running; for completeness, I use
[Athlinks](https://athlinks.com/ "Race results") to track my race
results).
