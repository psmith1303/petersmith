The movie [Tampopo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092048/), spawned a
restaurant in London called [Wagamama](http://www.wagamama.com/) (and
that in turn spawned a cookbook). If you've seen the movie, then you
won't be surprised to find out it's a noodle house. And now there is
[one in Auckland](http://www.wagamama.co.nz/).

Lisa and I went there for lunch, and despite the queue it was well worth it.
The [menu](http://www.wagamama.com/pdfs/menus/auckland.pdf) was full of
tempting dishes---it was hard to choose what to have. However, I ended up
having a chilli chicken ramen (which was super---I the soup base was
particularly good), and Lisa went for the hottest dish on the menu---according
to the waitress---the spicy chicken itame.

Despite being busy (we had to queue for five minutes) we were still in-and-out
in under 30 minutes.  The seating is what the Americans call "family style",
you sit at long tables with whoever else is there.  A great lunch. I
recommend it.
