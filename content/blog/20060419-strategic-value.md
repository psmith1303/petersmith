Where customer strategic value will be increased by combining
products and/or services from a building supplier, the supplier that
organises so as to recognise and adjust to the customer strategic
needs by offering an optimal package, will be able to bid a higher
price, competitors not combining their offerings in such a way,
and yet offering similar strategic value to the customer and record
a similar probability of success i.e. the integrated builder will
make a higher expected profit.
