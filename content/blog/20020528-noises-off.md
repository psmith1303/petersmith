How strange, it is a month since we last went to the theatre.

Anyway, at the last moment Chris had two spare for _Noises off_ at
the
[Bruce Mason Theatre](https://www.bmcentre.co.nz/). So off we jolly well
went. What a riot. To quote the press release:

> Quite simply the funniest play ever written about theatre. "Noises
> Off' follows the on-and-off stage antics of a touring company as
> they stumble from dress rehearsal to disastrous last night of the sex
> comedy 'Nothing On'---Everything that goes wrong does, as the cast
> desperately tries to hang on to their lines, their performances
> and the furniture. Amid such comic confusion, can they ever get to
> the end of the show?

Cast includes Peter Elliott, Mark Hadlow, Ilona Rodgers

Well it was all true. I've seen the
[movie](https://us.imdb.com/Title?0105017) before, but this was even
funnier. There is a magic that happens in a live performance which
is different to the big screen.
