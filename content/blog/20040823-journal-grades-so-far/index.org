I think it was Celeste who asked to see all the grades, so that she can compare her performance with the class average. However, since grades are, by nature, categorical, I feel an average is mathematically unsound, so here are the (sorted)grades for the class so that you can compare your position with everyone else.

Note: I'm at home at the moment, so I'm working off an old list that is missing a few of Darl's grades--nevertheless, I think it should do the job.
