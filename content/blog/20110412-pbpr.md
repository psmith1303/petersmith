## Notes on my goals

I am following a training plan that typically sees me doing three runs
per week. A tempo run, a fartlek or sprints type of run, and a long run.
The first two are short runs, between 10 and 15 Km. My long run is
typically between 25 and 32 Km. This year, I'll be doing some work to
improve my pace and to improve my tolerance for hills.

So, whilst my goals require some stretch, I think they are achievable.

I'm not being lured into long (long) distance running as, unlike
[Andrew](https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com), ultra-marathons hold no
interest to me.
