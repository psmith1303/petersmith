I've stumbled on to a couple of sites that I'm quite enjoying. The first is [[https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/][Academhack]]. It focuses on a subject dear to my heart---the intersection of teaching and technology. So, I've signed up to the author's [[https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/feed/][RSS feed]]

Whilst reading the Academhack, I came across a reference to [[https://www.theproductivestudent.com/][The productive student]]. It makes very interesing reading ... especially the dicussion on [[https://www.theproductivestudent.com/featured/how-latex-helps-me-write-a-paper-without-microsoft-word/][LaTex]]
