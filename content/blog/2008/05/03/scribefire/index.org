Well I'm making some progress on writing more here. I'm now using [[https://www.scribefire.com/][ScribeFire]] as my publishing tool. Hopefully, the fact that it is easier to "write' will encourage me to do more writing.

I chose ScribeFire because it is often mentioned when [[{{< ref "/blog/2008/04/13/zotero" >}}][Zotero]] is mentioned.

It actually took me several attempts to get ScribeFire to work. What I didn't realize was that [[https://www.movabletype.org/][Movable Type]] actually has a separate password that is used for remote [[https://www.xmlrpc.com/][xmlrpc]] access.
