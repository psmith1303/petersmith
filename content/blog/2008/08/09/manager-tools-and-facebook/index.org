I was talking with [[https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com][Andrew]] when he happened to mention how many /friends/ he has on [[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=647536402][Facebook]] (about 477 today).

And then today, I listened to the [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2008/07/the-myspace-cast-part-1-of-2/][Manager Tools podcast of Facebook]] (and [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2008/07/the-myspace-cast-part-2-of-2/][part 2]]).

It makes interesting listening. I suspect that many of our students would also find the ideas presented in the cast interesting too.
