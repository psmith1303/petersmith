This is a brief summary of:

> Ranson, S., Hinings, C. R., & Greenwood,
R. (1980). The structuring of organizational structures.
_Administrative Science Quarterly, 25_, 1    -17.

One of the most enduring "problems' in organizational theory is
the question of "How do organizations change?" In particular, how
can we incorporate both the structuralist perspective, with its
emphasis on constraints and the integrationist perspective with
focuses on the agency of organisational actors and their ability to
shape their context.

The idea of organisational structure can be understood in two
different and competing ways. Firstly, and classically, it can be
seen to simply a configuration of activities that is
characteristically enduring and persistent? (p.1) which is
manifested as a formal roles    --for me this is a succinct conflation
of the ideas such as specialisation (aka division of labour), and
administration. It is this view that emphasises constraint. The
other way in which structure can be understood is as "the patterned
regularities and processes of interaction" (p. 2), with its
emphasis on agency. Whilst there has been some research and discussion
on this approach, much of the undergraduate study of OT (Organisation
Theory), a has been ground in the structuratlist rather than the integrationist literature.
Now it is important not to through the baby out with the bathwater.
The classical notion of organisational structure has important (and
well researched) consequences when it comes to explaining the
effectiveness of the organisation. Nevertheless, structure as
the patterns of interaction    --what people actually do    --might provide a
much deeper understanding. Alas, for some people see them as
"incompatible" (p. 3). 

This has not deterred the article's authors (or
others) from working with this problem. The approach they adopt is to
focus mainly on the _analytical level_[^1] of meaning and
causality.

At this level (of meaning) makes "explicit the way reality is
experienced from the pot of view of the action and, _by dissolving
"factual reality' as the skilled accomplishment of members_,
sustains the agency behind much organizational working: actors reflexively
monitor their experiences and thus remake and recreate that experience" (p. 4,
my emphasis).

One of the interesting comments the authors make, is that that studies of the
"micro', _because_ of the research methods they employ are necessarily going to
privilege the agency of actors, over the constraints of the context (aka
macro). So we should not be surprised, when research into agency says that
agency is important.  Thus, in order to test/understand this we need to look
for a solution that incorporates the issue of _time_    --and by doing so, we can
    look at the issue of causality.

At this point, they bring it altogether and saying:

> Three abstract and interdependent conceptual categories are
integral to a theoretical model that seeks to articulate the way
in which the process of structuring itself defines and mediates
organizational structures: (1) Organizational members create
_provinces of meaning_ which incorporate interpretive schemes,
intermittently articulated as values and interests, that form the
basis of their orientation and strategic purposes within
organizations. (2) Since interpretive schemes can be the basis of
cleavage as much as of consensus, it is often appropriate to
consider an organization as composed of alternative
interpretive schemes, value preferences, and sectional interests,
the resolution of which is determined by _dependencies of power_
and domination. (3) Such constitutive structuring by
organizational members has, in turn, always to accommodate
_contextual constraints_ inherent in the characteristics of the
organization and the environment, with organizational members
differentially responding to and enacting their contextual
conditions according to the opportunities provided by the
infrastructure and time. (p.4)

And there we have it. Provinces of meaning. Dependencies of power.
Contextual constraints. This is the genesis of their (Hinings and
Greenwood) later work on archetypes    --where they put forward the idea of
the archetype as an organisational configuration (as in the
classical concept of organisational structure) _plus_ the
interpretive schema of organisational actors[^2].
Here are a few key points on these three categories:

- Provinces of meaning
- They are "on the one hand, interpretive schemes that enable us
to constitute and understand our organizational worlds as
meaningful; on the other hand, the intermittent articulating of
elements of interpretive schemes as purposive values and interests
that lie behind the strategic implementing or warranting of
structural frameworks" (p. 5). I'd link this back to my interest in
Kelly's [Personal construct psychology](http://www.repgrid.com/pcp/)
this is really about how people construe things.
- "Such frames [provinces of meaning] typically remain taken for
granted and incorporate both evaluative sentiments about the relative
worth of things, as well as implicit "stocks of knowledge' and systems
of belief "which serve as the reference schema for my explication of
the world'" (citing Shutz and Luhmann, p. 5). For me, here we have a
direct link to the work of Argyris and Sch&ouml;n's single and double
look leaning. I'm also reminded that
[David Siedl](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230220946/http://www.bwl.uni-muenchen.de/personen/person.asp?id=999) is
keen on Luhmann and uses his work a lot in his work on
strategy-as-practice. That our "provinces of meaning' are taken for
granted, should be no surprise. They are embodied in our assumptions
about the world, and our assumption are, all too often, unspoken. But
the big link here is to values, which the authors place closer to the
surface, whereas, I think, Argyris and Sch&ouml;n would say they were
less accessible than that.
- Citing Cicourel, "they enable the actor to generate
appropriate (usually innovative) responses in changing situated
settings
-- to sustain _a sense of social structure_ over the course of
changing social settings" (p. 5). Again, for me there are links back
to psychodrama; after all, the idea of spontaneity    --creating new
responses like this
-- is at the heart of Moreno's psychodrama.
- This is the juicy part, the link to RBV;
"[provinces of meaning] embody a conception of the organization
and therefore a view of the appropriate allocations of scare
resources. The notion of interests is an "incorrigibly evaluative'
on
    --in that it refers to both the distribution of scare resources
and to the ineluctable[^3] orientation and motivation of members to
maintain and enhance their sectional claims" (p.7). We've know for
sometime that, as one moves up the organisational hierarchy,
managers see things differently, in terms of threats and
opportunities    --they must also see things differently in terms of the
resources they feel they have at their command.
- Dependencies of power
    - It has to be said, that structuring the organisation, is
necessarily an exercise in power by a few actors in the
organisation. In this way, we should consider those actors to be
privileged. This back to the earlier comment that "Since
interpretive schemes can be the basis of cleavage as much as of
consensus" (p. 4). This results in the production of interests that
can be seen as sectional.
    - It's good to remember here, that organisations themselves can
be seen as the exercise of power. Citing Perrow, the authors say:
"Organizations must be seen as tools    --A tool is something you can
get something done with. It is a resource _if_ you control it. It
gives you power others do not have. Organizations are multi-purpose
tools for shaping the world as one wishes it to be shaped. They provide
the means for imposing one's definition of the proper affairs of men
on men" (p.7).
    - Of course, I would argue that this is not limitless power, and
we can't shape the world endlessly. But, nevertheless, we can shape
to the extent of the power we wield. The rub is that it depends on "the
skill which actors bring to bear using these resources [power] and in
mobilizing support of their claims" (p. 8).
    - Now for some, this skilful application of power is manifest in
strategic decision making. But, it must be remembered that those in
power not only get to exercise their decision making fiat, but also
they "can suppress or thwart challenges to their values and interests
by confining the scope of decision making to relative "safe'
issues" (p. 8). This is done by shaping the basis on which "making
decisions" is understood. (Note to self: _Big idea_).
- Contextual constraints
    - I'm a big fan of the social construction of reality, but the
authors warn against giving it too much credence. They, via Luhmann,
suggest that currently organisational actors "more than in any
previous historical period [are] entrapped by his [sic]
institutional and organizational systems in that they are less
open to social reconstruction" (p.9). Indeed, this limited choice     -    -
the reliance on _contextual determinants_ is the basis of
Contingency theory--whereby the circumstances presented by the
environment, technology, etc, necessitate the organization
adapting in order that it remains efficient.
    - But the contextual constraints facing the organization are
not just a function of environmental characteristics. They are
also a function of organizational characteristics too (e.g.
scale of operation    --size; and the type of technology employed in
production    --more generally, the resources the organisation has at
its command).
    - The larger environmental characteristics, cf Emry and
Trist, etc, have been well documented and explored.
-- But organisations also exist within an _institutional
environment_    --see Neo-institutionalism?
    - There is a link here back to the provinces of meaning, as
these
shape the type of organisational responses to the situation
presented by the environment.

Anyway, there are some important implications of all of this;
namely, the five ways in which structural change can come about:

> there will be a change in structuring if organizational
members revise the provinces of meaning, the interpretive schemes,
which underpin their constitutive structuring of organizations"
(p.12).

> structural change can result from inconsistencies and
contradictions between the purposive values and interests that lie
behind the strategic implementing and warranting of structural
features" (p. 12).

> change may occur through organizational revolution resulting
from significant changes in the organizations resources     -    -
undermining the "dominant coalitions and permit the creation of
new power dependencies" (p. 13).

> Likewise, significant changes in the "situational exigencies'
(the contingency factors) can have a similar effect.

> Finally, "contradiction imperatives of situational
constraints", will lead to structural change.

Thus, structural change can arise out of changes or contradictions
of any of the big three; provinces of meaning, dependencies of power,
or contextual constraints (internal or external).
A brief note about causality. It terms of time we can think about it
as three temporal modes:

> evenements," the events, incidents and episodes, the
contemporaneous pieces of flotsam which "blind the eyes' and
dominate the present; "conjunctures," the medium-term movements of
population, trade cyles, transitions in political domination and
"structures," long-term durations of geographical and cultural
patterns (p. 13).

> In short, the closer the "horizon," the more visible the actor
but constrained by his [sic] context; in the longer time
perspective, actors become less "visible' but their frames of
meaning, the product of their structuring more determinate:
constituted structures have become constitutive (p. 12).
And there we have it. I would say, that somewhat counter-intuitively,
the more visible the actor (in the short term) the more they are
constrained. In the long term, the actor is less visible (as time goes
by) but the meaning they have made has an impact of the structures of
the organization.

## Notes

Overall this is an important article and I'm surprised I didn't
find (!) it earlier. Thanks to John Gray (and his PhD) for alerting
me to it.


[^1]: Levels of analysis ? this is something I need to remember. Too
    often the debate on levels of analysis in strategy-as-practice
    retreats
    to the ephemeral _micro_ or _macro_ without too much to hang
    one?s
    hat on.

    multiplicity of interpretive schemes in any one organisation.
