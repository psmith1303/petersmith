There is a really nice four minute presentation of the SCP framework at
[McKinsey](https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Enduring_ideas_The_SCP_Framework_2169?pagenum=1\#interactive_scp).
Other _enduring ideas_ can be found
[here](https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Enduring_ideas_The_SCP_Framework_2169?pagenum=1\#interactive_scp).

All the enduring ideas aren't 'in place yet', but McKinsey are slowly
rolling them-out.
