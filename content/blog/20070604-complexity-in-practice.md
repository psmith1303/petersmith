I see that [Colin
Campbell-Hunt](https://www.business.otago.ac.nz/Mgmt/staff/ccampbellhunt.html)
has something new in Human Relations. The full details are:

Relations_, 60(5), 793---823.

The abstract says:

> Theories of social practice point to a wide domain of largely
tacit social accommodations as the source from which the dynamic
structures of social practices are sedimented. The
strategy-as-practice initiative seeks to use these insights to widen
our appreciation of the origins and evolution of strategy in
organizations. This article suggests that this domain, and its
components, can be substantively and literally represented as a
complex adaptive system. Complexity gives access to a
considerable body of theory on the emergent orders that may arise
from social practice, and on the evolution of social order over time.
These carry important implications for the scope of practitioners'
agency in leading strategic change, for the locus of strategy in
organizations, and for the design of research strategies to
investigate these complex phenomena.

I wonder if this came out of the [workshop at the 2005 ANZAM
conference]({{< relref "20041208-anzam-strategising-activity-and-practice.md" >}})
that he, [Paula
Jarzabkowski](https://www.abs.aston.ac.uk/newweb/staff/detail.asp/sfldStaffID=A0000633)  
and I put on.

This year, I'm working on a paper with [Liliana
Erakovic](https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/lerakovic) and [Yvon
Dufour](https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/ydufour). The paper is due
on the 29 June 2007, but both Liliana and I leave in the next few weeks
to go to Europe for the [EGOS](https://www.egosnet.org/)
[conference](https://www.egosnet.org/conferences/collo23/colloquium_2007.shtml)
in Vienna. Let's hope we have enough time to complete it.

The paper is based on some of the work coming from
[strategy-as-practice](https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/) folk on
[pluralistic
contexts](https://hum.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/179) (since
that's what all three of us have in common).
