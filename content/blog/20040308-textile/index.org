I've just looked at the main web page for [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905191502/https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/][The reflective practitioner]]  and realised it doesn't parse the entries well. In particular the [[https://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html][Textile]] codes 
don't make sense to PHP (which processes the page). Hmm, I shall have to think about that problem.

We'll. I had been using the [[https://www.php.net/][PHP]] code to process this page based on the work of [[https://www.virtualvenus.org/archives/0307/multiple_blogs_merged_entries_list.php][Virtual Venus]] but alas, that had some problems. However, a few minutes Googling found a solution by [[https://www.sunpig.com/martin/archives/2003/06/12/multiple-blogs-on-a-single-index-page/][Sun Pig]] which seems to work well.
