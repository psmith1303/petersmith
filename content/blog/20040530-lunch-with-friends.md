Lisa and I met up with Brownie & Vicki Brown,
[Dennis & Kay Lally](https://www.akc.quik.co.nz/dennisl/), and [Brodie
Jones](https://www.oldfriends.co.nz/oldfriends/member_profile.asp?oldfriends_member_id=3765)
at Cafe Extreme in Newmarket. The common thread between us is that
Brownie, Dennis, Brodie, and I all worked together at [Philips New
Zealand](https://www.philips.co.nz/). We meet every 6 months, well may
each year, at the same place.

I surprised to hear that Brownie was at
[Woodstock](https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Woodstock%20festival).
He is such a good raconteur; he has so many interesting stories to tell, and
some pretty good(awful) jokes too. I could---and have---listen to him for
hours.

It was nice to catch up with everyone. Perhaps we should do it more
often.

Anyway, Brownie says that once he is out of hospital, we'll all go
for a ride on his boat round the harbour. From all accounts, with the
engine he has, it won't take long (smile).
So, here's to our next meeting.
