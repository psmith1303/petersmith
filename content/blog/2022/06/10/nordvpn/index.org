I use ~nordvpn~. It works well. Every time I re-install it on one of my linux boxes I forget how to login ... as I don't have a browser on them (command line only).  So the trick is to user:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

nordvpn login --legacy

#+END_SRC

That's it.

And then I need to tell it a few other things.


#+BEGIN_SRC bash

  nordvpn set firewall disable

#+END_SRC
