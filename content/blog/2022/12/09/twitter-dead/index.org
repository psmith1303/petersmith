I have deleted my account from Twitter. It seemed like the right thing to do. Maybe I am just following the crowd, but I have left Twitter -- normally, I'd put a link to it here, but it's dead to me now.

I am thinking about joining [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] but I am not sure that I need a social 'net' like that. Yes, it might be fun to set up a Mastodon instance ... there are links such as these to help with that:

- [[https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/custom-domain-mastodon][Getting Mastodon running on a custom domain]]

- [[https://tech.oeru.org/join-fediverse-installing-mastodon-40-ubuntu-2204-docker-compose][Join the Fediverse: installing Mastodon 4.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker Compose]]

But is that just another complication to my life? After all, I do have a re-occurring "TO-DO" of 'Simplify my life'. So, for now, I'll hold off on joining in.
