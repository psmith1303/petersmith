For a while I have had two items on my to-do list. One said "Archive website" and the other said "Get one-page website". I thought I was over having a blog, and as part of simplifying my life, I was going to do away with it---, more or less---and replace it with something like this (from one of my other websites):

{{< figure src="ThisIsNotTheWebsite.png" title="Some other website" >}}

Then, today, into my RSS feed came [[https://theacademicdesigner.com/2022/winners-of-the-2022-best-personal-academic-websites-contest/][Winners of the 2022 Best Personal Academic Websites Contest]]. My first thought was, what's the difference between an Academic Website and any other? "The contest recognizes the best personal websites of: Faculty, Professors, Scientists, Postdocs, Grad students, Independent researchers".  They are all pretty polished for sure. And it's a very different list compared to, say, [[https://blog.feedspot.com/academic_blogs/][20 Best Academic Blogs and Websites]] which has classics such as [[https://thesiswhisperer.com/][The Thesis Whisperer]]. As a side note, I had forgotten how good the Thesis Whisper is ... and it's not just about theses. Her post on [[https://thesiswhisperer.com/2022/12/02/looking-back-at-the-pandemic/][What can we expect in the next phase of the pandemic?]] is jam-packed with meaty food for thought. 


But back to the theme of this post; killing or keeping my site.

I've gone with keeping it. Looking at it, I really like it. The integrations with Emacs for creating posts and webmentions is pretty smooth now.

But yes, there are things to be done. The workflow around [[https://indieweb.org/][Indieweb]] is a bit clunky. I have to run a [[https://petersmith.org/blog/2022/01/10/third-steps-to-indieweb/][script]] that picks up any new mentions from [[https://webmention.io/][Webmention]]. It's clunky and I need to do some stuff to automate it so that when new mentions are found, it rebuilds the site. But then I need to put is some checking in case someone 'bombs' the site with junk. For now, at least, it will stay a manual process.

The workflow around images is also clunky; I have to move them manually into the right directory. That dissuades me from using more images. Fixing that might take some more time learning [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][elisp]] to integrate it into my Emacs workflow. We'll see ...



But, the main thing is that commonplace book of mine is staying.
