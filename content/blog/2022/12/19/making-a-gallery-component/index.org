So, I want to be able to display a few images in an elegant way. As something of a gallery. There are lots of 'widgets' out there to do it for Hugo, but they all seem to rely on a good deal of Javascript. Yet Hugo has some pretty niffty [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/][image processing features]]. So, I wonder if I can do a gallery just using Hugo (and some CSS).

Let's see ...

... this page is going to be kind of messy as I test the build

I aspire to have the flexibility offered by the [[https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery][Hugo short code gallery]]. It's based on a rather powerful shortcode that handles a lot of options.

#+BEGIN_SRC html

  {{</* gallery match="images/*" sortOrder="desc" rowHeight="150" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true */>}}

#+END_SRC

# more

My Gallery starts here.

{{< gallery match="*" sortOrder="desc" rowHeight="150" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true >}}
