The first phase creating a new theme is complete. The site renders "ok", and I am pretty pleased with how it looks. It feels clean and elegant.

The one question I have is should I change the font for the title of articles ... Except for 'code' blocks, I am using a single font throughout the site, so I don't feel bad about adding a second font. Perhaps, something cursive? Adobe's California?

But there would be problems, as using such a font would definitely increase the 'weight' of my pages, and that's something I am actively trying to reduce.

Anyway, back to the plan for this theme. The next steps are to:

1. Make it 'responsive' (again).
2. Get IndieWeb working (again).
3. Get web-mentions working.

That last point is the whole reason I started down this 'rabbit hole'. The previous theme didn't really lend itself to accommodating web-mentions (in all their glory).
