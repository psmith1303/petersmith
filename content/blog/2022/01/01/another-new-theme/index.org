My current theme, NewPapyrus, looks rather like a page printed on paper; i.e., like this:

{{< figure src="NewPapyrus.png" title="A screenshot of the NewPapyrus theme" >}}

When I first saw a site that looked like this, [[{{< ref "a-refresh" >}}][I quite liked it]]. However, whilst it does the job, it isn't elegant. It's functional, but I have come to think that, aesthetically, it is lacking. After all, what is the point in replicating paper on a screen?

Looking at  /typographic/ sites such as [[https://ministryoftype.co.uk/][The Ministry of Type]], I am inspired to do something different to what I have (and maybe more like them).

So, I'm starting on a new theme called /TypoTyro/ which I hope to make more pleasing to the eye.
