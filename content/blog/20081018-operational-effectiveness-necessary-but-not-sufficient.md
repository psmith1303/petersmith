In his HBR article _What Is Strategy_,
Porter argues that operational effectiveness does not represent a
strategy. In other words, planning to be the most "operationally
effective" is not a strategy.

But I wonder how true this is. Having looked at, and worked with,
many SME (Small and medium enterprises), they
often have low levels of operational effectiveness. However, much
of the time it doesn't matter because _they are as effective as the
firms with whom they compete_. Operational effectiveness is a
relative term. Providing a firm is similar to its rivals in
operational effectiveness, operational effectiveness cannot
provide an edge.

In large firms, management has often paid been a lot of attention to
operational effectiveness. Consequently, any further improvement
is likely to have limited impact; all the firms tend to be very good,
so the cost/benefits of becoming more operationally efficient is
limited.

However, this isn't the case in SME. Because
they are often relatively operationally inefficient (compared to
their larger brethren), there are significant improvements that can
be achieved at relatively low cost. Thus, such improvements can be a
source of significant "differentiation" for a firm.
