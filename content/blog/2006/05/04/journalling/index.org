Well, despite some encouragement from Chintaka, and some inspiration from Anja, I'm still not doing much here. Having said that, I should mention that things are pretty full on at the moment. After my entry on grading, I was surprised to find that the topic came up at the recent /Board of Studies/ for the GSE. More particular, we had a very robust discussion on grading-on-the-curve. No doubt we will be continuing that discussion (as we always do). I think it is hard to work at any educational establishment without the topic arising from time to time.

I'm not sure if that is a symptom of the fact that both systems (norm reference and criterion referenced) both have their shortcomings, or if it a sign there is little to choose between them â˜º
