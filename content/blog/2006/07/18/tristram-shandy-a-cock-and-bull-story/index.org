I haven't read the [[https://www1.gifu-u.ac.jp/~masaru/TS/contents.html][book]] so I can't make any comment about the accuracy of this movie. What I can comment on is how much I enjoyed it; and enjoy it I did.

I know that [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/fivelive/entertainment/kermode.shtml][Mark Kermode]] like the movie (I listend to the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/fivelive_aod.shtml?fivelive/kermode140706][podcast]]) so I was expecting a good movie, and I was not disappointed. This movie will be one for my DVD collection.

The cast was impressive. There were so many names and faces that I recognised from elsewhere. The lead characters [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176869/][Steve Coogan]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117339/][Rod Brydon]] were very funny. There impressions of [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/][Al Pacino]] had me laughing so much I though I was going to hurt myself.

Given the very English cast, this is a [[https://www.tristramshandymovie.com/][BBC movie]] after all, I was surprised to see [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000096/][Gillian Anderson]] in something more than a cameo role.

Overall, 4 stars out-of-5.
