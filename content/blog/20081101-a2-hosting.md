Talking with [Andrew](http://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/) about hosting
providers, I thought I'd put in a good word for the folks at [A2
hosting](http://www.a2hosting.com/1315-5-1-63.html)

Over the past couple of years, they've provided me with darn good
service (and a really good price). Try them; you might like them.
