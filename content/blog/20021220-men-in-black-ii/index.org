Well I've just finished watching [[https://us.imdb.com/Title?0120912][Men in Black II (2002)]]. Not a bad ironing movie.

What's an ironing movie? When I'm ironing I like to watch a movie. It mustn't be too engrossing or else I don't do the ironing. Likewise, it can't be too "sophisticated" or else I can't keep track of what's going on. So it needs to have a relatively straight forward plot---can't be subtitled (or else how can you get good creases?) But it does need to have sufficient holding power to distract me from the boredom of ironing. Typically, these movies tend to be action orientated, or classics that I know.

Anyway, back to Men In Black II. Not bad ---the ironing was completed by the time the movie was over. Always a good sign.
