It's a long story, but at the end of the day, I wanted a little raspberry pi 4B, to auto login and run a script (on the console only).

This is how I got it going.

# more

First, I modified ~root~'s ~.bashrc~ file to have this line that runs a script when I login on the console.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

  # If I'm on the console then run the start.sh scrip
  #
  #
  [ `tty` == /dev/tty1 ] && /root/start.sh

#+END_SRC

Great. I can test that it works, and it does.

Next, in the directory ~/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d~ The directory may or may not exist, so create it if needed.

Then create I create a file called ~override.conf~ in that directory, with the following content.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

  [Service]
  ExecStart=
  ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin root --noclear %I 38400 linux

#+END_SRC

I can test is the auto login works (without rebooting), by executing the commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart getty@tty1.service

#+END_SRC

If that all works, then it's time to reboot ... and hopefully, job done. I but no, it's broken. Back to the drawing board :(
