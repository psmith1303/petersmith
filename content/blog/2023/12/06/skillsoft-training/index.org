Here at the University of Auckland, we have access to the library of courses and training from Skillsoft. Browsing through the immense catalogue, I notice a short course (30 minutes or so) on containerised application. So, I thought I would give it ago.

You can see that the full name of the course was *AWS SysOps Associate 2021: Application Containers*. Overall, it was pretty straightforward.


Well, I say that; the course is based on docker, and I have been using ~docker~ for sometime. Consequently, what was talked about in the course wasn't that new to me (other than using the *AWS* services to run containers). I'm not sure I would have felt that way if I hadn't already been a ~docker~ user.

The course was of the "chalk and talk" variety; there was no interaction, let alone "No try this yourself". From that perspective it wasn't engaging.

Nevertheless, I learnt enough to get the badge :)
