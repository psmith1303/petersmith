This [[https://www.downes.ca/post/75380][post by Stephen Downes]] took me to this [[https://blog.tcea.org/interactive-touch-screens/][piece on the adoption of interactive touchscreens]]. I won't repeat much (if anything) of what was said there, but led (via a tweet) to this diagram on deep learning created by [[https://www.impact.wales/][Impact Wales]]. What a chain of links! There is so much 'curation' of content going on here.

But my point was that the digram is very useful, such that I wanted to keep a record of it.
