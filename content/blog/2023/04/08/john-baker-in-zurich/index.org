It was surprising to find this place---a full bakery---on one of the poshest streets in Zürich (Bahnhof Strasse), alongside shops like Dior, Van Cleef 8 Arples, and so on. They have their own flour, that is milled here in Switzerland. All in all, an impressive opeation

Maybe that is why it is so popular.
