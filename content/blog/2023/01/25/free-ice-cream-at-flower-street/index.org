Free ice cream courtesy of the Link Alliance. Yum, yum, yum. There was also some street art. I couldn't quite make out what the text said. I think it is, "Forget about the last one.

[Chorus]
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
