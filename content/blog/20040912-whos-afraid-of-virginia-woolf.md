Lisa and I went to the [Maidment Theatre](http://www.maidment.auckland.ac.nz/)
last night, and saw _Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf_.  I enjoyed the
[movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061184/) when I saw it, but I enjoyed the
play even more.

Whilst the whole caste were good, I think that Hera Dunleavy deserves a special
mention. She gave an powerful performance in the role of _Honey_. I don't
really remember Honey in the movie, but I'll never forget Hera as Honey---a
very moving performance. Bravo!
