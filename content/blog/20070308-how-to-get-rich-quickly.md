Following on from my [previous
comments]({{< relref "20070308-economics-and-business-why-rate-rises-wont-work.md" >}})
on the Official Cash Rate it occurs to me that the people making
serious money at the moment are those who are able to tap into the
great engine of arbitrage that this behind the housing boom.
Anyone who can "clip the ticket", particularly Banks and Real
Estate Agents must be making a bundle. One, only needs to look at the
number of [Aston Martins](http://www.astonmartin.com/) being driven
round Auckland to realise how well some people are doing out of
this-boom.
