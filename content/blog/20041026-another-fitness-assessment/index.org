I had another fitness assessment at the university's [[https://www2.auckland.ac.nz/recreation/][Recreation- Centre]] today. Here are the results.

Overall, my weight loss has plateaued but I'm definitely fitter. I think I need to adjust my diet somewhat. It'll be interesting to see what the doctor says next. Most-interestingly-was how poorly I did on the sit ups---my boxing training has done a lot to improve on my "abs' but it didn't show on today's test. I'll have to think about that (is it the test itself?).

Anyway, the results were:
