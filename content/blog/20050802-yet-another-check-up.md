Another three months, another check up.

Lots of blood tests and a raft of diabetes tests (just in case).
Everything is okay. What stands out is my HDL
Cholesterol (the good stuff) continues to move up to 1.4 mmol/l from
1.2. This has made a big change to my Total/HDL ratio, which is now 2.9
--- not bad. I credit that
to my homemade muesli. Whoever thought I'd be "knitting my own
muesli.

Blood pressure is pretty stable at 132/85---but it could be better
yet. More exercise and less eating is needed.

Overall, a big tick from Doc Budelmann.
_Quick summary then_
