In his classic article, Arch W. Shaw explores _Some problems in
market distribution_ (Shaw, 1912). He describes how production is
only one half of industry; having produced the product it needs to be
distributed. The choice of method to distribute the product needs
careful consideration. Selling direct to customers, using one's
own salespeople, using wholesalers, and other intermediaries all
have an impact on the value that the producer receives that the
consumer receives and that the middlemen receives.

In many ways Shaw's model of distribution pre-dates Porter's value
chain (Porter, 1980) or value system in showing how organisations
are linked together. It is often assumed that the most value is
obtained by those people who are closest to the customer. For example a farmer
growing coffee beans in South America gets very little value for his
beans compared with the price the final consumer pays for a
cappuccino. Where, in this chain of distribution, is the most value
being appropriated by the various middlemen?

This does not always mean those his best to be selling direct to the
customer. Sometimes this is wholly impractical or cost inefficient.
Using the example above, is it realistic for the farmer growing the
beans to sell his produce to the end-user i.e. the coffee drinker? The
same is probably also true for the manufacture of baked beans does a
consumer actually what I baked beans as a distinct purchase from the
producer, or would they rather purchase than baked beans as part of a
collection of products at the same time at the supermarket? Similar
examples can be found for when it is best to sell through wholesalers,
distributors, or other middlemen.

Shaw also makes the point that the needs and wants of such middlemen
are almost always different to those of the end consumer; they have
different conceptions of what is valuable. For example a
wholesaler may only be interested in selling a product if they believe
it is in some demand at the right price by retailers. Whereas
retailers may only be interested in selling the product if they
believe that the consumer values the product over other products.
As an aside, Shaw's article is also interesting in explaining the
development of modern distribution systems.
