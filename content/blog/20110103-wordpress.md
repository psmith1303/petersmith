I've been using [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) for a long
time now. But its somewhat idiosyncratic develop, the frequent
inability for themes/styles/templates to migrate between versions has
proven to be too much. So, I'm making the switch to
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (version-3.0.4).

No doubt I've broken a few things in doing the
export/import; but hopefully I can fix them as soon as I figure
out what is broken.
