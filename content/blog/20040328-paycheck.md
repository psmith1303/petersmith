Took a few hours off from writing new application for [ethics
approval](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/cir_research/index.cfm?action=display_page&\>page_title=res_approval)
to see Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman in
[Paycheck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337/). I quite enjoyed it;
but it certainly is in the _ironing movie_ genre. Since we had free
tickets, I wasn't too disappointed by it.

Lisa thought the plot was weak, and I tend to agree with her. Not only
that but the action sequences were "over-engineered'. I feel that Jonny
Woo's style is showing its age.

Interestingly enough though, it did raise a topic I've mentioned here
before of structuralism vs. existentialism. Maybe not in those
words, and I'm sure a philosopher would debate my use of the terms and
their applicability to _Paycheck_. But, it did look at how much we
can shape the future, if the future is know to us. For example, suppose
a firm has detailed information about its sole competitor, what are
the outcomes? And if they know that the other knows, what then? I
suspect that game theorists would have a ball (and would consider
the films "logic' to be rather weak too).

I haven't seen [The butterfly
effect](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/) yet, but I image that,
like _Paycheck_ it cause me wonder about points of leverage and how
little needs to change in order to have a large effect. (The old, _if a
butterfly flaps its wings in a rain forest it can cause a hurricane on the
other side of the world_, line.)
