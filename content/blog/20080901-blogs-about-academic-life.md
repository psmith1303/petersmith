I've stumbled on to a couple of sites that I'm quite enjoying. The
first is [Academhack](https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/). It
focuses on a subject dear to my heart---the intersection of teaching
and technology. So, I've signed up to the author's [RSS
feed](https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/feed/)

Whilst reading the Academhack, I came across a reference to [The
productive student](https://www.theproductivestudent.com/). It makes
very interesing reading ... especially the dicussion on
[LaTex](https://www.theproductivestudent.com/featured/how-latex-helps-me-write-a-paper-without-microsoft-word/)
