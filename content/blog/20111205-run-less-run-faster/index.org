I'm a fan of the [FIRST](https://www2.furman.edu/sites/first/Pages/default.aspx
"Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training") "Run less, run faster"
programme. So, I've cobbled together a
[spreadsheet](/images/FirstMarathon.xlsx "spreadsheet") that does most
of the heavy lifting in terms of working out the timings that one needs to do.
Just change the yellow cell to reflect your 5K race pace (that you have/can
actually-achieve).

For a brief(ish) summary of the programme, you can read the [article at
Runner's
World](https://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244---11816-0,00.html
"Run less, run faster: An article from Runner's World").

FIRST actually have two programmes, one for a first-time marathoner, and one
for the experienced runner. This spreadsheet is for the experienced runner ....
despite the file title being _FirstMarathon_.

Finally, my friendly spreadsheet auditor has yet to cast his eyes over
this, so use it at your own risk.
