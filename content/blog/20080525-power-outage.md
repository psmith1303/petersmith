I've been working on a paper for a conference at the [Clifford
Chance Centre for the Management of Professional Service
Firms](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ccc/). The paper is due in the next
couple of weeks and progress is pretty good (so-far).

I do a lot of work by remote access to my computer at the University.
Alas, I forgot that today, the Business School building is having
its power turned off so essential work can be done on the "live side'
of the mains circuit.

Now, suddenly, I find myself unable to access my computer at
University (and all my notes). Oy-vey!

So, I guess, I'll just have to do some writing in long-hand...
