Amongst the stream of articles that turn up through my [[https://www.google.co.nz/reader][RSS reader]] was one for pulled pork, aka [[https://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cochinita_pibil/][cochinita pibil]]. [[https://uk.cbs.dk/degree_programmes/cbs_graduate_school/kandidatuddannelser/leadership_and_management_studies/menu/faculty_staff/faculty_staff/line_coordinator/eric_guthey][Eric Guthey]] had told me how great pulled pork could be, so I thought "why not?". So, off to [[https://www.mexicanspecialities.co.nz/][Mexican Specialties]] for some and 24 hours later I had some of the most delicious pork ever.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I should say that my darling wife made some picked red onions to go with the pork. It was the perfect accompaniment.
