We went an saw the Oscar winning [The lives of
others](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/) this evening. As [Mark
Kermode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kermode) said, its good but
[Pan's Labyrinth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/) is better.

Both of these films are well worth seeing.
