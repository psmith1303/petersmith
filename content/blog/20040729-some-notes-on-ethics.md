I brief, mentioned
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20040727-post-exec.md" >}})
about teams seeking to deliberately sabotaging other teams. I don't know if
this happens in this
[course]({{< relref "20040308-mgmt-301.md" >}})
or not, but I was thinking about those comments when I read:

> White, J., & Taft, S. (2004). Frameworks
for teaching and learning business ethics with the global context: Background
of ethical theories. _Journal of Management Education, 28_(4), 463---477.

So, I'd thought I'd recount a few of thier ideas, and see if anyone found they
relate to the way in which they approach things in general, or the course in
particular.

In the article two general Western approaches to ethics are discussed;
teleological and deontological.  Teleological[^1] approaches to ethics focus on
the consequences of actions. It is the consequences themselves, whether they
result in harm or not, that are evaluated rather than the actions themselves.
The major teleological theories of ethics include _utilitarianism_, _egoism_,
and care.  Utilitarianism[^3] focuses on the social costs or benefits of
decisions. A common version of utilitarianism is the idea of _the greatest good
for the greatest number of people_. Thus utilitarianism, considers everyone,
even if it doesn't benefit everyone. On the other hand, egoism is about
obtaining the greatest good for oneself, and doesn't consider anyone else.  The
ethic of care, whilst also deontological, considers the impact of one's actions
on others, and not only considers harm but also peoples feelings.  The
interesting thing with the ethic of care, is that it explicitly requires one to
consider the context in which actions/decisions take place.  E.g. are there
some conditions where it is okay to kill someone?

Deontological[^2] approaches to ethics sometimes referred to as _the categorical
imperative_. That is to say, there are some actions that, in themselves, are
intrinsically good. Thus, "A moral person makes an ethical decision based on
what is right, using moral principles or rules, _regardless of circumstances or
consequences_" (emphasis added, p. 466). But what should these principles or
rules be? Citing Kant's view, the categorical imperative is "Every person
should act only on those principles that he or she would prescribe as universal
laws, applied toe everyone, assuming what is right for one person is right for
all persons" (p. 467).  There are a number of "regimes' that come from this
approach. The _rights perspective_ is based on the notion of basic human
rights, such as those articulated in the American Constitution.  Similarly, the
_justice_ approach seeks to use universal principles to judge what is fair
(with variations for compensatory, redistributive, and retributive justice).
Finally, the _virtue ethic_ desires that people follow agreed upon rules---i.e.
they live their lives by specific virtues.  For me, I tend to use a mixture of
both approaches. In some areas (particularly when dealing with students), I
tend toward Utilitarian approaches. However, I'm also aware that there are
times when I've _bent the rules_ for students because of the situation/context.
Then again, if you look at the [Academic Honesty Assistance
tutorial](http://qa.cecil.auckland.ac.nz:8000/) (Aha---which I helped to
develop) you'll see elements of deontology. And no doubt, from time to time, I
fall back on egoism.  Truth be told, I suspect that we all use a variety of
ethical guides for our behaviour. But, I wonder how much our choices, say
taking the ethic of care approach, or a justice approach, is driven by a muted
reliance on egoism?
