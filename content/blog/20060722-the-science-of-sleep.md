So, having watched [The
Method]({{< relref "20060722-the-method.md" >}}) we
rushed down to the Civic for the 21:15 showing of [The Science of
Sleep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354899/). As we were waiting for the film
to start, I made the comment that the seats at the
[Civic](http://www.civictheatre.co.nz/) are much more comfortable than those at
the [Sky City Theatre](http://www.skycity.co.nz/). The people sitting next to
us piped up and agreed. Talking with them, it seems they are going to _35_
films during the [festival](http://www.nzff.co.nz/). Wow! What stamina.
However, they reported that there is someone who is seeing over _60_ of the
films.

Back to the film.

With films late in the evening you need something that is going to keep you
attention, and this one did. The "TV Studios" set where Stephane plays
out/creates his dreams was wonderfully kitsch. I also liked the way the film
drifted between French and English in quite a seamless way.

Being a French film, it did have the French _J ne sais quoi_ about it, which I
always find endearing.

For this film, I'll go with three out of five (worth seeing).
