[Google](http://www.google.com/) still isn't
crawling the site (much). I think part of the problem is that there are very
few sites which link to this one. Besides [The
Woolseys](http://thewoolseys.com/) and
[Consulting](http://consulting.co.nz/), I can't find many sites that link
here.

Oh well. I expect time will take care of that problem.
