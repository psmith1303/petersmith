If I'm to believe my scales, I am now 30Kg lighter than at "peak Peter".
So it's time for a before and after shot. However, I was surprised when
going back through my extensive photo archive, how I've managed to
avoid being photographed over the years ... I wonder why.

Anyway, here is a before from a couple of years ago:

"Big me")

Perhaps this photo shows why I avoided having my picture taken. Anyway,
having lost some weight, I'm now doing some running and here is a
picture of me at the recent [Cathay Pacific half
marathon](http://www.coolrunning.co.nz/races/cathaypacific/).

That's quite a different look for me, and I'm still getting used to it
(as are the people I work with).

My current fitness goals are to do a half-marathon in 1:40:00 or
less (a New York marathon qualifying time for someone my age), and to
do a full marathon in 3 hours 40 or less.

I'll try for the 1:40 at [Huntly
half-marathon](http://www.huntlyhalf.co.nz/) later this year, and the
3:40 at the [Auckland marathon](http://www.aucklandmarathon.co.nz/).
