I've noticed that when I quote something, by using block-quotes, e.g.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  block quotes
#+END_QUOTE

the subsequent paragraphs don't display correctly under Internet Explorer-. They are fine with [[https://www.mozilla.org/][Firefox]]. I suppose I should look into at some stage. Alas, the only time I have is at home, and their I don't use Microsoft... So it might have to wait until the next time I work during the weekend (which should be a long time away).

/I've fixed it/.

Alas, Internet Explorer doesn't handle having a left border and no right border well. Removing the borders and colouring the blockquote gets around the problem. I found this by accident.
