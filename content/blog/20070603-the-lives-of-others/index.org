We went an saw the Oscar winning [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/][The lives of others]] this evening. As [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kermode][Mark Kermode]] said, its good but [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/][Pan's Labyrinth]] is better.

Both of these films are well worth seeing.
