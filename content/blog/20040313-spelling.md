Sometime the interface to [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org/)
can be a little hard to work with; especially for that simple task of
creating a journal entry. I find a lot of spelling mistakes slip through. So,
at the moment, I am trying out [Zempt](http://www.zempt.com/). Zempt allows me
to create the entry on my computer, _check the spelling_ and then upload the
entry to my blog. I'll be interested to see how it works out.

Of course, a program like Zempt can't fix all the other problems, such
as: grammar, coherence, flow, etc. (but maybe one day).

I'm also trying out a program called
[w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/). I'm not sure which is better yet---I'm still
weighing up the pros and cons of each.

What I will say is that the spell check on each system is rather idiosyncratic.
Zempt seems to work best; but it doesn't remember new words ((It seems that the
dictionary problem is known to the folks at Zempt, and they are working on
it.)). (i.e. the dictionary add function doesn't seem to work). W.bloggar, on
the other hand, doesn't handle URLs well and doesn't have a British dictionary
(and the US dictionary throws _British_ up as an error).

Also, Zempt, being targeted solely at MovableType, does seem to
handle the features of the underlying blogging system better (e.g.  formatting,
categories, etc.).
