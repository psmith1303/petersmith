This is the end of the Friday Five. I know most of you have seen this coming and I appreciate you humouring me. I haven't enjoyed it for some time now and because of that I can no longer justify the bandwidth. I'm not going to give it away or sell it or bring anyone on to help; Two-and-a-half years is a good run. Let's let it go. :)
