In writing my piece on [[{{< relref "20091222-referencing-here-and-now" >}}][referencing]], I just [[https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=apa+referencing][Googled 'apa referencing']] and here are the first page of search results.

{{< img src="googleapa.png" title="Google search results" >}}

I was surprised by the results. First, I used Google.co.nz instead of Google.com (I normally use the later), and secondly the [[https://www.auckland.ac.nz/][University of Auckland's]] referencing resource [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090325081529/https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/][Referen©ite]] did not feature at all on the first page.

I see:

- www.waikato.ac.nz
- www.aut.ac.nz
- www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz
- library.ucol.ac.nz
- library.curtin.edu.au
- library.canterbury.ac.nz
- library.manukau.ac.nz
- www.southernoceansoftware.com
- owl.english.purdue.edu
- aut.ac.nz.libguides.com (again)

But there is no sign of Referen©cite. I wonder why Google does not refer to Referen©ite on the first page (that's a rhetorical question; I know how [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine][search engines]] rank sites).
