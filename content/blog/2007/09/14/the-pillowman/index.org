[[https://www.yellowoasis.org/][Lisa]] and I went to see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillowman][The Pillowman]] tonight.

It was marvellous. We both enjoy a black comedy and this was very black and very fun. The crucification scene was particularly well done---and particularly harrowing. Hat's off to [[https://www.aucklandactors.co.nz/ViewFullCV.pl?objectID=519][Brooke Williams]] for a great performance.

I also thought that Jonathan Hardy was very droll as the policeman Tupolski.

All in all, I recommend this play.
