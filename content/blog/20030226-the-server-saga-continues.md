Well, another problem has raised its ugly head. The on-board SiS 900 LAN
controller is also not correctly recognized. I'm going right off the
[ASUS](http://www.asus.com/%20motherboard). In case anyone is interested its a
_P4S533_. I thought I might have problems with the video, so I made sure that
the card was a _standard_ (I used a GE Force card), but I never expected these
problems. ASUS has always been trouble free in the-past.
