I met with Amit Chand yesterday. He is a former MGMT 301 student.  Since then
he has worked with Unilever in Australia and with Telecom New Zealand (in New
Zealand). Anyway, he starts work in a few weeks time at McKinsey. He will start
his training in Chicago, but will return to---and be based---here in New
Zealand.

Over coffee, we talked on to the topic of the disinterest---i.e. not pushing a
particular agenda---of consultants. In summary, I asserted that whilst the
consultant may be (should be/likely to be?) disinterested, the nature of
consultants results in the "solution' the present will come from a particular
set of solutions. Specifically, the practices (Reckwitz, 2002; Schatzki, 2001;
Turner, 1994) they draw upon bounds the type of solutions offered to the
client.

For example, a consultant/consultancy where economics practices loom large is
likely to produce a solution that accommodates those type of practices. In this
way, the "biography' of a person shapes the solution. I don't think I want to
go into the agent-structure debate here, so I won't dwell any further on that
point.

Amit then asked me a very interesting question; "What shapes your solutions?"

Without thinking, I immediately said "For me, the elegance of the solution is
important." Thus, finding a solution is an exercise in good judgement. This may
be a folk-tale, but when asked "What is good taste?", the Queen responded, "I'm
not sure, but it is important to have it."

I think elegance, is related
to [aesthetics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics) (which
takes me back to work and discussions I had
with [David Barry](https://www.geocities.com/drdavidbarry/)). As I
write this now, and as I think back, what strikes me is the strong
relationship between practice (and those who write about it) and
aesthetics. Perhaps, at the [EGOS conference](https://www.egosnet.org/)
next year, I'll catch up with Daved/David and explore this in more
detail.
