Today I was asked if I would be acting as a discussant at the next PhD
conference. I'd see the emails about the conference and had already
decided that I wasn't going to put a paper forward and that I wasn't
going to act as discussant.

Why?

Although I glibly said "It's not my core business", what I really
meant is that I had asked the question _Does it make the boat go
faster?_ [^1], and the answer was no.
Having spent sometime thinking about what I do here, there are only
three things that make up my "boat" here :

- Teaching well
- Publishing two good articles per year
- Finishing my PhD

So, when I'm asked to do something, if I can't see an immediate and
direct connection to making the boat go faster, then I'm probably
not going to do it.

"So", I can hear someone saying, "what about your blog?"

Good question. I regard self-reflection as fundamental process in
becoming a better manager, teacher, and researcher. This blog
provides a semi-structured forum for me to engage in self-reflection, so
I'll keep on doing it (as much as ever, and possibly a bit-more).
