I was supposed to meet with Pete Mazany first thing this morning to
talk about my PhD. Alas, I think we both ran out of time and had to
abandon-it.

Went to a great seminar by Kevin Scholes of [Johnson and Scholes ---
Exploring corporate
strategy](https://www.pearsoneduc.com/book.asp?prodID=100000000004706&d=BS)
fame. It is nice to meet someone who is so passionate about their
teaching. He is also a great story teller.

Had a chat with Biljana in marketing about [Mike's
Bikes](https://www.smartsims.com/). It was good to talk about a subject
that really interests us both.

I've noticed that that the battery in my old [Palm
Pilot](https://www.palm.com/) is pretty low. In fact I really should get
around to backing it up. Alas, when I upgraded to Windows XP I found the
Palm desktop software would no longer install and work correctly. Having said
that, a search of the Palm site indicates that an updated desktop (4.10) is
available. I'll have to try that later.

Added a couple of more tools on the footer. Now it is possible to view
the page in a format that is more printer friendly. It is also possible
to view the source code for any particular page---just click on the ?
(if you can see it). All I need to do now is to get the email working ...

At last I've managed to set up everything so I can update this
remotely. It's amazing what technology can do.

Oy vey! Well I installed the new Pilot desktop when I got home to
night.  Alas, my little Pilot well and truly crashed during the Hot Sink. Even
resetting it wouldn't work. So, I took the option to clear the data.
So, I have a working, but very empty Palm Pilot.

Oh, and I didn't have a back up. Doh!
