Today, I saw [[https://www.uea.ac.uk/nbs/people/People/Academic/Yehuda+Baruch][Professor Yehuda Baruch]] from the University of East Anglia at Norwich run a workshop called /Opening the black box of academic reviewing and editing/. The session was jointly hosted by the [[https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/sitemanager/index.cfm?fs=pgv&pageid=23121][department of Management and International Business]] and the [[https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/][department of Psychology]].

It was a most informative session, so much so that subsequently, I got his book out of the library.

As much as the workshop was useful the book is even better. If I get some time, I'll summarise the ideas-here.
