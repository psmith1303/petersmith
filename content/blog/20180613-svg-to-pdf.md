I'm using [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name/en/) most
excellent [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package to
create my courseguide
for [BUSINESS 705](https://www.courseguide.info/).

One problem I have is that I use SVG images. That's all well and good
when I am rendering the courseguide as an HTML book, but when I try
and produce a PDF, bookdown (well LaTeX) chokes. It's no one's fault really. It's just a fact of life.

So, I need to convert my SVG images into PDFs. That'll fix the problem.

The way I do it is

```bash
$ inkscape mygraph.svg --export-pdf=mygraph.pdf
```

Easy!


I then created a `Makefile` to cycle through all the SVGs in the
`images` director and convert them. I'm not sure how smart the
Makefile is, but it works.

```Makefile

#
# Convert the SVG files to PDFs
#

SVGFILES := $(wildcard *.svg)

all: $(SVGFILES:%.svg=%.pdf)

%.pdf : %.svg
	inkscape --export-pdf $*.pdf $*.svg

```
