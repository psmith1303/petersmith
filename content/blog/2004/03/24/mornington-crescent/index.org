[[https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/dkolb][Darl]] and I have spent sometime talking about the game of [[https://www.dunx.org/mc/][Mornington Crescent]] (For details of the real basis of Mornington Crescent have a look at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Crescent][Wikipedia]]). In particular, I've been thinking about it in relation to David Boje's [[https://cbae.nmsu.edu/\~dboje/papers/DisneyTamaraland.html][Stories of the Storytelling Organization: A postmodern analysis of Disney as Tamara-Land]].  From recollection, [[(https://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/][Boje's]] thesis (in the article) is that organisations can been seen as a collection of concurrent, and competing stories. Perhaps, for some people in some organisations, rather than playing out stories, they are actually playing out games of Mornington Crescent---games where the rules are wholly unclear (and possibly misunderstood).

Perhaps if we view organisations attempts at strategy as games of Mornington Crescent, that might explain why there is such contradictory evidence for the efficacy of strategy (There probably should be a reference here).

By the way, did you know that David Boje's current [[https://www.nmsu.edu][university]] is one of the greatest centres of research on chilli plants?
