With regards to supervision of PhD and DBA candidates, there seems to be some good ideas at work in Australia. Firstly, only people on the University's /Research Register/ can supervisor doctoral candidates. The situation is looser for those doing masters thesis.

To get on to the registers, one has to:

- have PhD,
- co-supervise on doctoral candidate to completion, and
- pass an annual half-day workshop on supervision.

Once on the register, one can be the main supervisor for a doctoral candidate. It sounds like a better plan than we have at my institution.
