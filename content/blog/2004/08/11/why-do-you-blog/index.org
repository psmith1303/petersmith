I was talking with [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070526211006/https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/][Amit]] yesterday, and he was saying that he keeps on journalling/blogging because it forces him to reflect on what he has done. I think, like me, he finds it hard to be reflective in "the moment". No doubt a psychodramatist would refer to this an example of the cultural conserve inhibiting spontaneity.

Any way, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070526211006/https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/cxq/][Cao Xue-qin]] asked me why I blog. Well, there is a part of me that enjoys the "sound" of my own voice. However, the three main reasons I blog are:

- To keep track of what I've read and where I've been
- To force me to write more and to reflect
- To remove some ambiguity from students lives, by saying what I am
  thinking (oh, that's a bit egocentric, isn't it).-

Okay, so there are two main reasons.
