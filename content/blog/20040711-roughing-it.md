![An English BBQ ](/images/DCP_2184.JPG) 

On my recent trip to [EGOS](https://www.egosnet.org/), Lisa and I spent a couple
of days in the UK catching up the Lisa's family. Here I am with Malcolm, her
brother-in-law, cooking at a BBQ in the "English' manner---that is to say in
the pouring rain.  It actually had been a lovely day up until we started to
cook.

We also took the time to go on the [London Eye](https://www.londoneye.com/). By chance, rather than by good
planing, we got there early and didn't have to queue too long. This is a lovely
picture of Lisa, with London in the background, taken in mid 'flight'
as they call the ride.
