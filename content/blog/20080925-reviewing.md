Today, I saw [Professor Yehuda
Baruch](http://www.uea.ac.uk/nbs/people/People/Academic/Yehuda+Baruch)
from the University of East Anglia at Norwich run a workshop called
_Opening the black box of academic reviewing and editing_. The
session was jointly hosted by the [department of Management and
International
Business](http://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/sitemanager/index.cfm?fs=pgv&pageid=23121) and the [department of
Psychology](http://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/).

It was a most informative session, so much so that subsequently, I
got his book out of the library:


> _Winning reviews: A guide for evaluating scholarly writing_. (2006). (p. 262).
Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan. 

As much as the workshop was useful the book is even better. If I get
some time, I'll summarise the ideas-here.
