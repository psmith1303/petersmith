[Jim Munroe](http://nomediakings.org/about) has produced a very entertaining
and helpful guide to time management.

I really like it's counter-cultural style. So, if you have time check out his
[time management for
anarchists](http://nomediakings.org/vidz/time_management_for_anarchists_the_movie.html)
