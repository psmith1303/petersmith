I've decided to step down from my role in the GSE. It's a shame, because I enjoy it so much. However, there are so many competing demands for my time, that I can't give the GSE the attention it deserves.

Que sera.

So, once I'm back from [[https://www.egosnet.org/conferences/collo24/colloquium_2008.shtml][the conference in Europe]] I'll return to my [[https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/sitemanager/index.cfm?fs=pgv%20&pageid=23121][home department]].
