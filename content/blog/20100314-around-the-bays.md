[Around the bays](http://www.roundthebays.co.nz/) is an Auckland
tradition. So, I had a go this year. My time for the 8.4km was 45
minutes 47 seconds or about 10.5 km/hr. Lisa assumes that I'll do it
next year---she is probably right. Now I have a target to beat.

[Andrew](http://www.andrewisgettingfit.com) did it in about 41 minutes
(having run the distance from the finish to the start). Outstanding!
