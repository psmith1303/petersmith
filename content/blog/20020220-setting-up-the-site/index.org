I spent quite a bit of time today setting up the-site.

Of course, not knowing much about [[https://web.archive.org/web/20020510162004/https://www.zope.org/][Zope]] slowed me down a bit.

Nevertheless, it is working. I've used a bit of code for the [[https://www.zope.org/Members/regebro/luf_cms][LUF Content Management System]]. No doubt, [[https://regebro.wordpress.com][Regebro]], who wrote LUF, will also recognise the style of the site too.
