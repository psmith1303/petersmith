The title of this is a pun on "work, work, work" said by [Mel
Brooks](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000316/) in [Blazing
saddles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/). Of course he isn't
doing any really work---but I was.

I chose to go into to school to write, and it's been a really productive day.
With now real distractions, or easy diversions, I just got on with the task at
hand---writing. Well, I did have a few minutes diversion, printing out the
complete
[PBRF](http://www.auckland.ac.nz/cir_research/index.cfm?action=display_page&page_title=Res_PBRFreport)
and apparently tying up the printer for hours (I didn't hang around for it, and
it's over 250-pages).
