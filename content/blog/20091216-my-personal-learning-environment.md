[Jo Badge](https://drbadgr.wordpress.com/about/) talks a bit about her [personal
learning environment](https://drbadgr.wordpress.com/tag/ple/), and so I thought
I'd draft out mine. I'm really web-centric and spend most of time "in'
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html) (I sometimes
think about switching to [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), but I'm hooked
on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)).

I found it interesting to consider what is missing here ... there is no
PowerPoint. I so rarely use "slides'; often all I have is a single
slide so students coming into class know they are in the right place.
Increasingly, when I need slides I'm trying/learning to do them using
[Beamer](https://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/). Having said that, for
the odd complex set of ideas I do use 
[MindManager](https://www.mindjet.com/) in presentation mode to show how
I see the connections between things.

Since writing this, I've come across Hull, Pettifer, and Kell (2008).
They present an interesting figure, which seems to show how much I can
actually do in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (which is most of it).
