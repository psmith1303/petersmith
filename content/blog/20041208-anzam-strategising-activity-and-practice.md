For the next few days, I'm in
[Dunedin](https://www.dunedincity.govt.nz/city/?page=search_new) attending the
2004 [ANZAM](https://www.anzam.uts.edu.au/)
[conference](https://www.commerce.otago.ac.nz/mgmt/ANZAM2004/index.html).  The
main reason for being here is to give a workshop on _Strategising activity and
practice_.  In fact, I'm running the workshop in conjunction with [Paula
Jarzabkowski](https://www.abs.aston.ac.uk/newweb/staff/detail.asp?sfldStaffID=A0000327)
and [Colin
Campbell-Hunt](https://www.business.otago.ac.nz/mgmt/staff/ccampbellhunt.html).
[Gerry
Johnson](https://www.gsb.strath.ac.uk/worldclass/research/profiles/showprofile.asp?htmlid=1&subsection=Profile&)
staffid=11 was going to be here too, but alas he can't travel (from Scotland)
at the moment (he was also going to be the keynote speaker at the conference
too).  About 60 people registered for the conference, but not everyone turned
up.

What was most striking for me was how few people had read anything (not even
the [JMS special issue](https://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/toc/joms/40/1/))
on [strategy-as-practice](https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/). I think for
the majority of participants, this was their first exposure to
strategy-as-practice. This has me wondering how much I might be missing out on
in new areas of development. When one tends to focus on reading a few journals,
how can one be sure that one is keeping abreast of what is happening across a
whole field.? In particular reading the [Strategic Management
Journal](https://www.jstor.org/journals/01432095.html), which many would say is
the pre-eminent strategy journal, does not provide coverage of
strategy-as-practice or other, dare I say, non-American, views. In addition,
I'm reminded that [John
McGee](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/csgr/people/associates/warwick/mcgee/)
told me that may good academics feel that their best work was published in
second-tier journals.

So, I'm left wondering "How does one, keep "up to-date'"?
