Milos, one of the students on the Auckland MBA sent out an email today saying
that his new venture, a coffee shop, is opening today. So, I ventured out to
441 Queen Street where his Columbus Coffee shop is.

It's a beautiful location, and the shop itself is well presented.  I think he
can do well there. What I like about Milos is the clarity that he often brings
to his thinking. He has a clear plan of the stages he needs to go through to be
successful (and I'd be surprised if he wasn't successful).

I had a hot chocolate (I try to avoid coffee after 3:00). It was good---I
hope the rest of the class finds time to sample his wares.  It was nice to
catch up with him outside of the "cloisters' of the University. It reminds me
of the time when I ended up visiting Vodafone with Lisa. I wonder if it would
be good to see more of the students in their own "worlds' rather than just at
the University.
