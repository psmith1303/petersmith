I'm stepping down as the bibliographer of the [[https://www.strategy-as-practice.org/][strategy-as-practice website]]. That site is going through a redesign, and as part of that, the team is considering how/what to do with the bibliography.

My own view is that a social bibliography, such as [[https://www.citeulike.org/user/psmith][mine]] might be more useful than a stand alone bibliographic silo.

As many people know, I keep [[https://www.zotero.org/petersmith/items][my bibliography]] in [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]]. Zotero also does community base groups too, such as this one on [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/strategy_as_practce/items][strategy as practice]]
