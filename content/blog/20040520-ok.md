The final word in
[Armi's](https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/) [journal
entry](https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/archives/000345.html)
was "OK". That brought back some strong memories from last night's
psychodrama training. One group member, the protagonist, had just
finished saying a rather long and deep piece, and at the end of it the
director simply said "OK".

Well the trainer, probed to find out what was behind that rather simple
statement. As it turned out, there was a lot more behind the ?ok? than
just an acknowledgement or encouragement of what had said by the
protagonist. The "ok" was masking a whole lot of understanding and
assumptions---a bit of a double edge sword really. So, as I write this
I'm carrying over feelings from last night which prompt me to think
"what is the other side of this?" What understandings and assumptions
has it raised for me.

Perhaps one is around leadership. I'm not sure that [Wilfred
Bion](https://mythosandlogos.com/Bion.html) and his
[ideas](https://cbae.nmsu.edu/\~dboje/503/johari_window.htm[1]) are
fashionable in the leadership literature. Anyway, to summarise
on of his ideas (rather poorly), Bion suggests that when things don't
work out the way they want it too, the group will often "kill' the
leader and seek to replace him/her with a new one (who is often seen as
a saviour). This, unsurprisingly, can be cyclical.
So there it is my weak understanding of the situation. Only those
who are in the situation can assess which parts are assumption and
which parts are useful understanding.
