It's going to be a busy weekend. We're seeing five movies over the weekend. Today started off with more animation at the [[https://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz/][film festival]].

The two best films were [[https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0490473/][Der Propellervogel]] and [[https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0482549/][Moongirl]]. Kazkaheutte was pretty good too. The audience (mainly children) seemed to enjoy them all (and enjoy them immensely).
