Tonight we went along to
see [Pecking Order](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6760956/), courtesy
of [Flicks](https://www.flicks.co.nz/). What a delightful film about
the world of competitive chicken (and other birds) raising.

The documentary team did a great job of showing the passion and
expertise of those involved in this somewhat niche hobby. Perhaps
calling it a hobby does it a disservice; there were plenty of folk for
who it is much more serious than that.

Definitely a film to see.
