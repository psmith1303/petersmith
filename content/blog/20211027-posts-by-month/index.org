I want to get a count of blog posts by month. Actually, I want to do that for each of my types of content. Ultimately, the idea is to generate a sparkline, rather link [[https://aaronparecki.com/][Aaron Parecki]] does on his website.

The code I finally ended up with looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC go



#+END_SRC
