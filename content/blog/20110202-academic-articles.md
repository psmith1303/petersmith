I've talked about [Research as a Second
Language](http://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/)
[before]({{< relref "20091213-research-as-a-second-language.md" >}}).

I've been particular taken by the systematic way in which Thomas
Basb&oslash;ll takes to pieces (and puts back together again) the art, craft, or
science of academic writing.

I think his latest thoughts on [writing an academic
article](http://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/2011/02/five-at-time.html)
is particularly helpful. I'll have to let some of my co-authors see
this.
