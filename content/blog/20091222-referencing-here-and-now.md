As I look back at [my last
entry]({{< relref "20091222-whither-learning-styles.md" >}})
it occurs to me that I use two distinct approaches to citing and
referencing ideas, works, _etc_. Specifically, I use a mixture of
[hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) and [APA
referencing](https://www.apastyle.org/).

My habit seems to be that for non-academic works, I tend to use
hyperlinks that go to appropriate sources. This seems consistent with
normal practice of web-based publishing.

For scholarly works I follow APA conventions for citing and
referencing. This seems more consistent with the academic expectations
and practices. In acknowledgement of the fact this is electronic or
web-based publishing I use [COinS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COinS)
to ensure there is enough information so that programmes such as
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) or [LibX](https://libx.org) can
scrape/find all the information they need to quickly locate an
electronic copy/source of the document.

However, I feel mildly uneasy about this situation. Should I use only
APA (albeit with COinS); after-all it does have citation styles for
blogs etc? Or should I only use hyperlinks; after all, this is the web?
For some things, such as blog entries, APA seems entirely sensible for
paper-based writings. However, for this (and other e-media), APA feels
out of place. I am use to clicking hyperlinks to take to "more
information". I think I can live with the mixed method of referencing.
At the end of the day, I do try and acknowledge my sources, and perhaps
it doesn't matter what means I do that by, providing most people
recognise that I am doing it; _i.e_., most people recognise the
practices that I am using.
