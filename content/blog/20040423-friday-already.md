And here is this week's [Friday Five](http://www.fridayfive.org/)
(Okay, I've recycled an old one, as there is no new F5).

- What was the last song you heard? Ya-Ya by Buckwheat Zydeco Ils sont Partis
  Band
- What were the last two movies you saw? Girl with a pearl earing and Paycheck
- What were the last three things you purchased? The _Queer Eye_ music CD, a
  MP3 player/radio/voice recorder (for Lisa), and a telephone extension cable
  (problems with the ADSL line).
- What four things do you need to do this weekend? Write more for my PhD, See
  _Kill Bill: Part 2_, Brunch out, and the MBA reunion dinner.
- Who are the last five people you talked to? Lisa, John Briers, Marie Wilson,
  Darl Kolb, Emma Dawson. I've just realised that when I'm working at home I
  talk to very few people except Lisa---to complete this item on the list people
  I had to go back to _Tuesday_.  

This was recycled from last years F5.
