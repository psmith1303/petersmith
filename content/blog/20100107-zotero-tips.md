I really like [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/). The more I use it, the
more useful and powerful I find it. Also, the technical support for the
product (from the community of users and especially from [Dan
Stillman](http://forums.zotero.org/account/6/) is outstanding.

Dan pointed out a really useful feature to me today. When adding items
to Zotero, sometimes the title of the item is published ALL IN UPPER
CASE or sometimes In A Mixture Of Upper And Lower Case (i.e., title
case). It is really tedious to fix by hand; but there is a better way.
In viewing mode (that's in the right-hand-side panel), right-click on
the title and choose "Transform text&rarr;lower case". It can then be
quickly tweaked to be sentence case.
