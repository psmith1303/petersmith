At times, it's been a bit of a chore moving to Pelican for my 'blogging' activity. Although the conversion process
should have been largely automatic, there was a lot of hand fixes that needed to be applied. This is mainly because I have
changed platforms so many times, and some of those times the conversions haven't been complete. So, I took this opportunity
to clean-up all the entries and fix all the broken bits.

I think I've largely done that. I need to do some sanity-checks (e.g., make sure all the links are working), but I think
most of the big stuff has been done.

Much of the fixups were done using 'sed' or 'vim'; you've got to love regex :)

But it was a fun process mainly because it made it necessary for me to go back and re-read what I've written before. So many 
happy thoughts tucked away in there.
