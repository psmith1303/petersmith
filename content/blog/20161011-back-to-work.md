This year, I have been on Research and Study Leave (also known as RSL or sabbatical). Having spent five months away in Canada and Europe, I am now back in New Zealand and am settling into a new work pattern.

Whilst away, I more or less worked all day, every day (except for a few days off here and there). My typical day was, breakfast, go to work, lunch and a 4 km walk, work, diner, a little work, and then bed time. It suited me.

Now I need a more normal pattern of work. But it has been a slow and hard transition. I guess, after so much work, I needed time to unwind again. Yes, really!

Anyway, I back on the 9 to 5 pony and being productive.
