I was looking at my web logs and the statistics that are produced for this
site, and I was curious why people come here. As you probably know, when you
use a search engine such as [Google](http://www.google.com/) or
[Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) information is passed about the site that referred
you (Yahoo or Google) along with the search terms that were used.

So what patterns do I see? Well firstly, some people come here looking for
information on strategy cases---I presume they are looking for some insight
that they can use in their class. I can't be certain if they are staff or
students, but from the IP/DNS entries, I suspect they are students. Cases such
as Swatch, and Karl Zeiss Jenna from the [de Wit &
Meyer](http://www.strategy3rd.com/3rdedition/) text book appear frequently.

There are another group who seem to be looking for information on [Mike's
Bikes](http://www.smartsims.com/). If anyone is interested I have "sure fire"
strategy for winning the first three (and sometimes more) rollovers. Alas, the
downside is that it hard to continue that winning into rollovers five and six.
As [Ken Simmonds](http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/html/faculty_profile.asp?ID=5786)
often states, anyone can increase profit by sacrificing the future value of the
company.

Finally, a few people looking for [Prof. Nigel
Haworth](http://www.aus.ac.nz/branches/auckland/Akld.htm) also end up here too.
I wonder what they want to know about him. Isn't his [university web
page](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/nhaworth) enough?
