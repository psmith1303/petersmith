It is Moreno, not Monroe. I just got one of his books out of the library. It's:

Moreno, J. L. (1978). /Who shall survive? Foundations of sociometry, group psychotherapy, and sociodrama/ (3rd ed.). Beacon, NY: Beacon House.

Quite a weighty tome; it's about 750 pages long, so it will take some time to read. I'll try a leave notes hear about the interesting-bits.
