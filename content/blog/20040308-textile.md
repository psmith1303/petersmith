I've just looked at the main web page for [the reflective
practitioner](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905191502/http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/)
and realised it doesn't parse the entries well. In particular the
[Textile](http://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html) codes
don't make sense to PHP (which processes the page). Hmm, I shall have to think
about that problem.

We'll. I had been using the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) code to process this
page based on the work of [Virtual
Venus](http://www.virtualvenus.org/archives/0307/multiple_blogs_merged_entries_list.php),
but alas, that had some problems. However, a few minutes Googling found this
solution by [Sun
Pig](http://www.sunpig.com/martin/archives/2003/06/12/multiple-blogs-on-a-single-index-page/)
which seems to work well.
