Well, another problem has raised its ugly head. The on-board SiS 900 LAN controller is also not correctly recognized. I'm going right off the [[https://www.asus.com/%20motherboard][ASUS]]. In case anyone is interested its a /P4S533/. I thought I might have problems with the video, so I made sure that the card was a /standard/ (I used a GE Force card), but I never expected these problems. ASUS has always been trouble free in the-past.
