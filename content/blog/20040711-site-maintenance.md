I guess you can tell I'm back by the volume of my postings ...  Anyway, I've
been running a couple of link checkers over the site to find any dead (or
incorrectly entered) links. I've fixed most of the problems that are internal
to the [site](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/) (i.e. within
http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/ ), but some of the links outside the
site have suffered from [link
rot](http://chronicle.com/free/2002/04/2002041001u.htm).  Of course, it may be
possible to find a copy of the material that has been lost at the [Wayback
machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php) (aka the Internet Archive).

I wonder how many people know their sites are being archived
like that?
