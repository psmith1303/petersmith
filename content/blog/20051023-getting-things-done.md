[Chintaka](https://web.archive.org/web/20071119131104/http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/cxq/) has been gentle
prodding me for sometime about the lack of activity here. I could comment on
the amount of activity at his blog, but I won't (smile).

He is right. I have been slow in doing anything here for awhile.  Well
hopefully that is about to change. I've being reading [David
Allen's](http://www.davidco.com/)
[book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670899240/) on _Getting
things done_.

The system sounds straight forward enough. So, I'm going to give it a go. It
will be interesting to see if I actually get more done.  On the way to finding
GTD (as many people affectionately call it), I came across a rather interesting
site called [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com). The name comes from need 43
folders in order to have a perpetual tickler-file.
