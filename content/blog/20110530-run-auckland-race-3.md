Sunday was the fourth race in the [RUN Auckland
series](https://www.runauckland.co.nz/about.html) at Northcote (I seem
to
have skipped reporting on the third race in the series). My summary of
the course is that what wasn't muddy was hilly. I don't mind the mud,
but the hills ... Anyway, after this race, I'm surprised at how good my
standing is (for my age group).

I'm no really looking forward to race number 5 to see if I can improve
on this. I think I can do a better race time (the next one can't be this
hilly; actually it can, it's at Western Springs, but there is only one
real hill and a long gradual downhill which should suit me). Alas, I
won't be able to complete the series as I'll be in Europe during the
last race. _Que sera_.
