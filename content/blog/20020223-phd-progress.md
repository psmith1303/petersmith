Well despite the Palm problems of yesterday, I do seem to be making
some good progress on my PhD proposal. I seem to have a research
questions; and I think I know the method I will use. They are a little
rough around the edge yet---but I hope to have something pretty
concrete by the end of next week.

Had a lovely breakfast at Corsa in [Mt.
Eden](https://www.arc.govt.nz/volcanic/mteden.htm). The coffee was
superb and the eggs Benedict was lovely. They use some wonderful
honey cured bacon instead of ham. Yum.

Picked a couple of videos from [Videon](https://www.videon.co.nz/). They
are with out doubt the best video store in town. [Watched Enemy at the
Gates](https://us.imdb.com/Title?0215750). A solid ironing movie
(something good enough to watch whilst ironing, but it doesn't require
all of one's attention).
