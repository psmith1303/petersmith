I think it was [Stephen Turner](http://www.cas.usf.edu/philosophy/turner/)
(2007) who lamented that much sociological theory is uninformed by our
contemporary understanding of neuroscience.

David Rock, in series of articles (2006, 2009) looks at leadership and
management from the perspective of neuroscience. One particular section caught
my eye, in which he writes about teams; the _Relating to relatedness_ of the
title.

This, of course, has implications for teaching, especially when teams
are used (as in team-based learning). We have always known that _how_
teams are put together is important, but this article gives us a more
nuanced understanding. It also reminds me how important it is for teams
to have some (structured) time to get to know one-another.
