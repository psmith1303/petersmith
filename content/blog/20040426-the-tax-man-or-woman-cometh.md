Some mail from the [IRD](http://www.ird.govt.nz/) finally caught up
with me. I was ---a little--- very surprised to find that that they felt I
owed them about 7,700 in penalty tax, interest, etc. According to
the tag line at the bottom of the statement, interest was accruing at
2.38 (which is about 11%---I wish I could get that from the bank).
Now, of course, I felt that I probably didn't owe them anything (I
tend to be a little bit obsessive about paperwork); but, I was
troubled by the thought that I might.

Anyway, I called the 0800 number, and waited in the queue for 10
minutes or so, then I was automatically transferred to another queue
(I know that because the second queue told me how long I could expect to wait).
That reminds me, I recall visiting one major Government department in the
mid-90s because I was looking to buy a PABX system (a phone system, aka a
switch) and the company I was buying from suggested I visit this particular
department. The managers of the department were delighted with their new phone
system because it had enabled them to reduce the _average_ time that
clients/customers/citizens were waiting in a queue from _three hours_ to _20
minutes_. Yikes!  Meanwhile, back to the IRD. After another six or seven
minutes in queue number 2, I was put through to a woman called Amy. I have
rarely dealt with anyone at a call centre who was as professional, helpful, and
considerate as she was. _Hats off to the IRD_. Some of the people with whom I
am training in
[psychodrama](/categories/psychodrama/)
work with the IRD---I must remember to pass on how my thoughts about how
excellent was the "service encounter'.  I think what came across most strongly
was here concern for me rather than the money. I know over the past few years
the IRD have been trying to make a huge shift in their culture (no small
undertaking), and from my point of view it is working.  (BTW, cultural change
is on my _very hard_ to achieve list.)

As a final aside, one of the most engaging movies about people in tax
department is [A taxing woman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093502/)
(Marusa no onna). It's Japanese with English subtitles, but it is so
funny. They made a sequel, but it wasn't nearly as-good.
