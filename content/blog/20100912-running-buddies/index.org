I've just noticed that [Andrew](https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com) has just
[dobbed me in](https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082306/https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/2010/09/10/contrasts/) as an
[occasional runner](https://runkeeper.com/user/Peter_Smith/fitnessReports/pr)
and his sometimes running buddy.

Thanks ...

I've been sort of running since about March 2009. I'd been taking a few
writing retreats at Orewa, [Totara
North]({{< relref "20090304-walking-the-dogs.md" >}}), and
Long Bay. In between writing, I'd walk a little. That turned into trying
5K runs, and it's grown. I started to get somewhat habituated to
running, and found myself doing it most Sundays.

I then began to think I might do the [Auckland
half-marathon](https://www.aucklandmarathon.co.nz/) and began doing the
occasional run with Andrew (so I could pick his brains about running).
This became a regular thing, and now we run most Tuesdays and Thursdays
for about 10k or so.

Today, for a change, we're planning to have a crack at the
[route](https://www.mapmyrun.com/run/new-zealand/onehunga/753123994072981910)
of the [Onehunga half-marathon](https://www.onehungahalf.co.nz/). If it
goes well we might do the official run at the end of the month ... but
that really depends on how it fits with our training plans (mine for the
Auckland marathon in October, his for the [Taipei
marathon](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Taipei_International_Marathon)
in December).

Anyway, I should be getting ready to run now ...
