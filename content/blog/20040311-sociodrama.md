[Judith McMorland](http://web.archive.org/web/20050307052941/http://www.colearnz.co.nz/) and
I have decided to run a short seminar or workshop for postgrad
students, Doctoral candidates, and staff. The title of the seminar is
_Exploring the year ahead: creating responses to challenges and
change_ and the flyer promises:

> An experiential participatory workshop for PhD and Masters
> students journeying into 'unknown territory' of postgraduate
> study (thesis writing, data gathering, interviewing,
> maintaining self, holding it all together?). We will identify
> typical and specific challenges and changes and explore ways of
> devising enlivening responses.

The basic plan is to do some role training. And before you ask, what's
role training:

> Role training is an effort to help us perform adequately in future
> situations. It is a method of learning that aims to bring about a
> rise in the spontaneity level of an individual and combine this
> with practice of a new expression. Making an apparently minor
> change in an area of our functioning, which we recognise as a role
> or part role, can result in a ripple effect in a larger sphere or
> system. Role training focuses on the development of one aspect of
> a role, but has in its larger view the transformation of the
> groups and culture in which we live. "[Wellington Psychodrama
> Training Institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20041114040426/http://psychodrama.org.nz/programme_wpti_training.html).

Anyway, at the bottom of the flyer is says that I'm a _sociodramatist
in training_. So, I shouldn't be surprised that some (thanks Karla)
has
asked "what's a sociodramatist"? So, as a trainee, I suppose it
would be generally a _good thing_ if I briefly outlined what
sociodrama is about. Firstly, let me start by saying that sociodrama
is not intended to be the therapeutic; whereas psychodrama, which is
from the same stable, is intended to therapeutically useful. Thus,
the sociodramatist tends to work more with typical roles, e.g. a
student who is Peter, rather than psychodramatic roles e.g. Peter as
a student. Secondly, sociodrama is an action method---there is a lot
of "doing", as situations are enacted out at various levels of
abstraction and concreteness.

The sociodramatist is concerned with the social networks of the
protagonist; and so overall the sociodramatist seeks to improve
the efficacy of people in groups. It is a method that helps one work
with groups---this is probably a gross simplification, and perhaps
those who are more experienced would say it differently, but it is
my current working definition.

I've been doing sociodrama for a little over a year know, and I am
slowly "getting it'. But, I suspect it will take many more years
before it really makes sense; hence the title "sociodramatist in
training".
