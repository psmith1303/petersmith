I end up at a psychodrama class to night. I say _ended_ because I
only popped in to drop off some books to the library at
[ATCP](http://www.psychodrama.org.nz/atcp.html).

I'd had some confusing calls during the day about classes being on,
so I went in just in case I was still confused (about the class being
on or off). It was on.

It was an unusual class. I wasn't really expecting to attend class I
wasn't warmed up (in the way that I usually am) for class. I was
strangely disengaged. Of course, that could be related to the other
things that are [going on for
me]({{< relref "20040508-a-wake-up-call.md" >}}).
But I did leave feeling somewhat unsatisfied. All the more so,
because Vivienne had challenged me with a line like "Are you getting
what you deserve? Are you going for gold in your life?"

I found these two seemingly simple questions difficult to answer,
and actually, I didn't answer them in any meaningful way. I recall
that I called my answer "unsatisfying". It was then, and it still
is now.

Having slept on it for a while, it occurs to me that I tend to take two
different roles. Firstly, there is the _happy rambler_, cheerfully wandering
through life, finding enjoyment in most things. Secondly, there is the _focused
achiever_, determined reach whatever goal he wants. The interesting thing is
the _focused achiever_ sometimes pretends to be the _happy rambler_
(especially, when things aren't going as expected), and sometimes the _focused
achiever_ is subsumed by the other.  I suppose that only having these two roles
is limiting, so I wonder how my role repertoire in these areas can be expanded.
