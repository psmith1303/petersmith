I am in the process of redesigning _BUSINESS 705 Qualitative Research
Methods_. Why? Well this will be the first time I am teaching this
course, and a redesign serves two purposes. First, it allows the
course content to be updated. Secondly, it forces me to engage with
the material in a deeper way. The process of actually having to teach
something, for me, helps to clarify/crystalise out my own
understanding of the topic.

It is not an easy process; I do not have a sense of how the class will
feel.

Of course I have many tools to help with the process; constructive
alignment, backwards design, and so on. But for me, I need to know the
shape of the beast. To use the metaphor of dress-making; one might
know all about the fabrics and their pros and cons, the different ways
of cutting and stitching fabric ... but with out the sense of the
final piece of clothing, one is likely to end up with something
utilitarian that engenders little joy or excitement.

I have signed up for [CleAR's](https://www.clear.auckland.ac.nz/)
workshop on course (re)design to help keep me moving forward. But, I'm
still looking for my creative 'in' to the design of BUSINESS 705.
