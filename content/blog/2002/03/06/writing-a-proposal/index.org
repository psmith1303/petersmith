I've been through the main documentation for the [[https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/circulars/awards/ttea.html][Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards]] in some detail. And, I've looked at the requirement our [[https://www.auckland.ac.nz/][university]] has. So, now I think I have a handle on the amount of work that is needed for this beast.

/Several hours later/ Well I haven't done much so far--in this area it
hasn't been a very productive day ... oh well, lets see what can be done
this evening.
