I've decided to step down from my role in the GSE. It's a shame, because
I enjoy it so much.
However, there are so many competing demands for my time, that I
can't give the GSE the attention it
deserves.

Que sera.

So, once I'm back from [the conference in
Europe](https://www.egosnet.org/conferences/collo24/colloquium_2008.shtml)
I'll return to my [home
department](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/sitemanager/index.cfm?fs=pgv
&pageid=23121).
