We are only allotted a certain amount of time to do what we want to
do. There will never be more than 24 hours in the day. But sometimes, I
feel like there isn't enough time.

For some time I've been saying I'd like to do more reading. Of late
most (all) of my reading has been linked to my research and teaching.  There
has been little time for "recreational" reading.  That was before I got my
[iPod]({{< relref "20050322-recording-on-the-ipod.md" >}})
and before I found out about [Audible](http://www.audible.com/). Now I'm hooked
on buying and downloading audio books. The beauty of audio books on the iPod is
that you can listen as you are walking from place to place. Now I can get
through two or three books a month extra---it doesn't sound like much, but it
really makes a difference.  Consequently, I'm taking the opportunity to "read"
things for which I would normally not have time. For example, I've just
finished _The life of Pi_, and I thoroughly enjoyed _The white Russian_ (Thanks
for the recommendation Leone). 
    
Of course, sometimes I drift back into _research mode_, and so I'm currently
listening to Jack Welsh's biography _Jack: Straight from the gut_.
