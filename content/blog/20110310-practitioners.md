One of my favourite writers on practice---[John
Postill](https://johnpostill.wordpress.com/)---made an interesting
[reflection on practitioners and
academics](https://johnpostill.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/academics-are-practitioners/).
He notes that:

> The conventional divide between "theorists' (e.g. media scholars)
and "practitioners' (e.g. journalists who teach at academic
institutions) that we find in higher education parlance is unhelpful. Both
scholars and non-scholars are practitioners, albeit of different kinds. That
is, both operate within fields of practice that require long years
of learning and secondary socialisation.

But I'm left wondering if the problem he expresses (more eloquently in
his full posting) is the consequence of how people overload meanings on
to words. For example, we use the word accident in our every day lives
and most of us recognise the meaning (which is often associated with
blame or responsibility). However, in medicine the word has a different
meaning ([An occurring symptom; esp. an unfavourable
symptom](http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/1051?rskey=tPHQMm&result=1&isAdvanced=false\#)).
And yet the medical profession routinely distinguishes between that
meaning and the more usual meaning.
