I did a 24Km today, and my new [XCT
Camelbak](https://camelbak.com/sports-recreation/spring-summer-hydration-packs/2011-octane-xct.aspx)
worked well ... It was good to maintain my hydration, and this felt like
one of my easier long runs. Actually, it was easier in pace, but I
didn't have the same sort of fatigue that normally accompanies my long
runs.

I quickly figured out how to drain the air out of the Camelbak so that
it didn't slosh around (turn it upside down and suck the air out of
it).  I also figured out how to tuck the mouthpiece down so it doesn't flap
around.

If there was a problem it was that the straps kept loosening themselves
off. I may have to fix that (permanently) once I work out the right
length for the straps. Nevertheless, it was pretty comfortable and I
didn't really notice the pack once I had it adjusted.

It was great to catch up with
[Andrew](https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/). We both noted/noticed how
much more enjoyable it is running with some one (as opposed to running
alone). He tells me he has a new pack from
[Nathan](https://www.nathansports.com/), but he forgot to bring it with
him today (and perhaps he regretted that). No doubt he'll write a
review about it sometime.
