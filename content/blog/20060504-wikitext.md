I don't know about everyone else, but I prefer to use a markup scheme when
writing rather than a WYSIWYG editor.  It's just that I prefer to see the
layers behind the presentation.  So, I've abandoned the WYSIWYG editor I had
been using and gone back to
[Textile](http://bradchoate.com/mt/docs/mtmanual_textile2.html).  Alas, I've
also been using [WikiText](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitext) and I've
found I prefer that system to Textile. All I have to do now is to find [a way
to get WikiText working
here](http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTWikiFormatPlugin).
