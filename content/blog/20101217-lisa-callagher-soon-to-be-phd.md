My friend and colleague [Lisa
Callagher](https://web.archive.org/web/20100513124031/http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/5272.aspx) submitted
her
PhD thesis today. Yay; and I'm so jealous.

Interestingly, even as she was walking it over to the Graduate Centre,
she was thinking on what/how she might change it. She says it's a sign
of being a "true academic'.

In her thesis, she uses theories of practice to explore innovation in
the bio-tech sector. We're both practice theorists at heart. I don't
recall how we found out that we shared similar theoretical views....
perhaps she'll remind me at some stage.

This transition probably signals her moving away from being a Senior
Tutor, and becoming a Senior Lecture. That's something of which she is
very deserving.

_Kudos, Lisa_ (and I don't often use bold).
