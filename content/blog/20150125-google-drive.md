One of the things I use heavily at work, and not much at home is Google Drive.
It is so convenient to have access to documents when I'm travelling. 

Alas, the support for Google Drive under FreeBSD is rather minimal. There are
solutions, but no of them support automatic synchronisation (mainly because
Google does not provide a Linux (or similar) Google Drive implementation). It's a shame really. 

It's also the reason that I end up running one Windows PC. Que sera.
