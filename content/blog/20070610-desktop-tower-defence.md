Sometime ago, [Jeremy Zawodny](https://jeremy.zawodny.com/) published a piece
entitled [Desktop Tower Defense Considered
Harmful](https://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/008758.html) Well he is right.

[Desk Tower Defence](https://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/) is a very
addictive flash based game. I've finally given up. I never cracked 8000 points,
but I did get over 7000. Playing the _challenge_ games, I got hooked on the
_one hundred_, but I've never gotten past level 77.  Anyway, as the voice at
the end of each game says, "Right, I better do some work-then"
