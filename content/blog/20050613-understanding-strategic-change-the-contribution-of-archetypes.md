The abstract says:

>  We examined the concept of archetype, implicit in a number of
contemporary approaches to the study of organizational design and change.
Despite an emerging interest in archetypes, the concept has received inadequate
investigation. The present article offers a basis for definition of the concept
and sets down three assumptions, which we tested using data collected
longitudinally from 24 organizations. We present a number of theoretical and
methodological implications of the archetype approach to the study of
organizational change.

I was reading an old article by Miller (1987) on the relationship between
strategy and structure (or is it structure and strategy), and in my notes I
asked the question "Is there a link between the notion of organisational
gestalts", which was very contemporary then, "and the idea of archetypes?" The
answer, based on this article is yes.  Organisational archetypes,
configurations, and gestalts are all part of the same quest to study how
organisations are transformed and develop---or to put it another way it is "a
central thrust of organizational theory ... the need to understand
organizational diversity through typologies[^1]" (Greenwood  & Hinings, 1993,
p. 1053).

Anyway, as I've said
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20040412-the-structuring-of-organizational-structures.md" >}}),
"An archetype is ... a set of structures and systems that reflects a single
interpretive scheme" (Greenwood & Hinings, 1993, p. 1052). The article seeks to
provide an understanding of large-scale change as an organisation moves from
one archetype to another (as opposed to micro or incremental changes within the
organisation).

Again, this article has a common heritage with other articles from these
authors. For example, it relies on the article by Miller (1987) that started
this current discussion---i.e. the three dimensions of decision making;
rationality, assertiveness, and interaction---and Greenwood;s & Hinings own
work on tracks (1988).

One of the things that struck me in reading this article is the hypothesis that
"organizations will develop structures and systems consistent with _a single
interpretive scheme_" (emphasis added, Greenwood & Hinings, 1993, p. 1056). Why
should this be so? Surely a firm could be developing multiple, contested
structures and systems? Greenwood and Hinings bring together a number of ideas
to explain why this isn't the case. The ideas of best, dominant coalitions and
shared culture are the main reasons given.

The second idea I took away from the reading is that an archetype would be
specific to an institution---that is to say they would not be "generic" in
nature. I always assumed that an archetype would be more like an "ideal-type'
of configuration.

From the point of view of _writing an article_ I was struck that in a
prestigious journal, such as the Academy of Management Journal, the fact that
the results were ambiguous did not preclude the article from being published.
That is good-news.


[1]: We westerners seem to love to [classify and
clarify]({{< relref "20040907-western-and-eastern-thought.md" >}})
(to mis-quote _99 Red Balloons_ by Nina). And yet, and yet this form of
knowledge making (as exemplified by the 2 x 2 matrix) is often something
academics look down upon.
