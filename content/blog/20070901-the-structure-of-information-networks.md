This sounds like a fun course:

> The past decade has seen a convergence of social and
technological networks, with systems such as the World Wide Web
characterized by the interplay between rich information content,
the millions of individuals and organizations who create it, and
the technology that supports it. This course covers recent research
on the structure and analysis of such networks, and on models that
abstract their basic properties. Topics include combinatorial and
probabilistic techniques for link analysis, centralized and
decentralized search algorithms, network models based on random
graphs, and connections with work in the social sciences.
