I seem to have spent most of the weekend working on the paperwork for our
upcoming [AMBA](https://www.mbaworld.com/ "Association of MBA programmes")
review. I've been sending versions of our self-report document backwards and
forwards to [Sue Laurenson](https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/s.laurenson
"Sue's staff page").

It really is a time consuming process, but it is really helpful to take stock
of the MBA programme this way. It reminds me of what Sarah Kennedy of
[Healtheries](https://www.healtheries.co.nz/) was saying at the MBA Business
Breakfast last Wednesday. Talking to the MBA students she talked about how
Healtheries had been put up for sale and had to go through vendor diligence. As
part of that process they were reviewed by [PWC](https://www.pwc.com/
"PriceWaterhouseCoopers NZ") and found the process very helpful in highlighting
some of the gradual changes that might have otherwise been unnoticed.

Anyway, for me, and I hope for our MBA programme the AMBA self-review has been
very useful.
