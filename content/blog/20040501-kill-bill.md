Well at last I saw [Kill Bill Volume 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/).
I was going to buy [Kill Bill Volume 1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/)
and watch it first, but alas I couldn't find a copy. I had assumed because it
was for rent at Videon that I was on general release---but alas no luck. It
seems that there are a few Zone 1 recordings available (at a price) and few
Japanese recordings too (which come with a "free' sword). Of course, the move
has been cut differently for the two markets.  Anyway, back to Kill Bill Volume 2. 
I do wish I'd seen Volume 1 again first. The movie pretty much starts where
the second one ends, and there isn't a lot of scene setting---it really is a
second volume, rather than a sequel.

Much of the movie is stylised after other (obscure) genres, and there
are many "in jokes'. At one stage, I reminded of every "Kung Fu' movie
I'd ever seen when living in Germany[^1].

Some of the scenes where quite harrowing; for example the entombment of Beatrix
Kiddo (Uma Thurman) was masterfully done.  As I was watching the credits at the
end[^2], I noticed that the writing credits were to _Q+U_, which Lisa quickly
pointed our was [Quentin](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/) (which I had
guessed) and [Uma](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000235/).

That started me off wondering about the film-makers art. It seems
that nowadays, many movies are written a produced (and sometimes
acted) by the same person. I wonder why that is? What is the impact on
the person who aspires to be a writer, only to find that a "star' has
their ideas accepted over the writers.

How might this play our in organisations? Or is it playing out in
them now?

Oh well, tomorrow it's going to be comedy with [Greg
Proops](https://www.gregproops.com/). That'll be a change from the
carnage of Kill-Bill.


[^1]: Back then, most movies were dubbed into German, and, to start with my
German was so good. But I found that I could enjoy Chinese movies because of
the style signalled the meaning of what was going on, so the words were less
important. Bring back the [One armed
swordsman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061597/)

[^2]: Is that a surprise? That I watch movies all the way through? E.g.  For a
laugh, watch [Ice age](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268380/) (a cartoon) and
see who the caters are.
