Lisa and I went to the [[https://www.maidment.auckland.ac.nz/][Maidment Theatre]] last night, and saw /Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf/. I enjoyed the [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061184/][movie]] when I saw it, but I enjoyed the play even more.

Whilst the whole cast were good, I think that Hera Dunleavy deserves a special mention. She gave an powerful performance in the role of /Honey/. I don't really remember Honey in the movie, but I'll never forget Hera as Honey---a very moving performance. Bravo!
