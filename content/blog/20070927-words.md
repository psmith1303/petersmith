Of late, I've been reading a number of things by Theodore Schatzki. In
particular, I have just finished reading:

> Schatzki, T. R. (2002). _The site of the social: A philosophical
account of the constitution of social life and change_. University
Park: PA: Pennsylvania State University
Press.

I am continually struck by the subtle, but important, differences
in the use of language in difference "genres' of academic writing.
This fact will come as no surprise to those who study discourse.
Schatzki, has a propensity to use two words that I rarely come across
in my usual reading. He likes _qua_ and _pace_.

_Qua_:
_In so far as; as; in the capacity of_
Example: When considering people qua strategists, one needs to distinguish
"strategic practices'.

_Pace_
_With due deference to; despite_
Example: Pace, those who study discourse, discourse is just another
practice.

I wonder how pretentious it would be to use those words in my own
writing---after all they aren't really part of my "genre'. 
I think I answered my own question.
