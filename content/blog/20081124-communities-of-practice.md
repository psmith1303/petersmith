It is so nice when ones research and teaching interests intersect. As I've been
studying practices, I've become increasing interested in the "situated" nature
of practices (Suchman, 1987; Sharrock & Button, 2003; Lave 1991).  This has led
me to become increasing interested in the notion of [Communities of
practice](http://www.ewenger.com/theory/communities_of_practice_intro.htm) This
lead me to some reports about [The Manchester
Method](http://leaderswedeserve.wordpress.com/2007/05/22/the-manchester-method-as-an-educational-innovation/)
as a means of teaching (especially with regard to MBA students). There is a
helpful [PowerPoint
sideshow](http://leaderswedeserve.files.wordpress.com/2007/05/manchester-method.ppt)
that puts the method into context (of course---where would we be without
context).
