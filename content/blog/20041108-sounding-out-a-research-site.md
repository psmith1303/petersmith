One of the more difficult things to do when carrying out research is to
negotiate entry into a research site (especially when carrying out case
research, which is what I hope to do).  Fortunately, [Nigel
Haworth](https://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/nhaworth) provided me with an
introduction to the Chairman of my "ideal' participant organisation.

So today, I met with the Chairman and we had an interesting discussion about the
firm and my interests and how those my intersect.  I'm really keen to do
research with this firm as they would be a rich source of data---and they are
large enough to be interesting to an international audience.

What's more, I think I might be able to provide them with some value too. So we
could all win from this.  Anyway, I'm back their next week as we continue the
process of "entry'.
