I've been going back through my old posts to make sure that they are
being rendered correctly by [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/).

As I have done that, its reminded me of the number of different ISPs
I have been with over the years. Of course there is Spar/Telecom, TelstraClear,
Clear, Paradise, Oricon, and then for a period I used a small ISP on the South Island.

They were pretty good too.

Most of the time---if not all of the time---I've changed to get been capacity
(often at the same price as before). So, over the years I've ended up paying
about the same each month for ever faster connections.

Oh, I remember the wonder of my first 1Mb ADSL link. That was a magnificent change
from my 2,400 modem. 

And now days, I'm on a 100Mb fibre link. How times have changed.
