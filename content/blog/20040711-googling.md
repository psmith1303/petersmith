I see that [Amit](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/) has
an
[interesting](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/armi/archives/000383.html)
comment on Google. He says that:

> Key words "armi reflective" appears number two in Google
amazing, "reflective practitioner" comes up about 6th ... amazing!
I'm a little surprise as I've been having problems getting google
to trawl the site correctly. Although Google comes to
<http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/>
every day or so, it never crawls through the whole web site. It just
reads the
[robots.txt](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/robots.txt) file
and the main index of [The
reflectivepractitioner](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/) and
then stops. I can't figure out what's going-on.

The [robot exclusion file](http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html),
that is to say
[robots.txt](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/robots.txt),
shouldn't stop it crawling. The meta data in the index.html page, i.e.

    <meta name="robots" content="index,follow,noarchive" \> 
    
shouldn't stop it---so what's happening? I emailed the folks at Google and got
a very general reply back. I should try emailing them again. In the meantime,
if anyone has an idea why the site isn't being crawled---please let me know.
