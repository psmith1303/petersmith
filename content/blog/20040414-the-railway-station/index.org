We went and had a look at the new railway station in downtown Auckland.  As we were wandering through the building I was struck by the beautiful windows. Click on the image for the full size picture.  The "window' is actually a glass dome in the ceiling.

It really is a lovely station, but it is a shame that there are no trains---I've been there three or four times and there is never a train in the station. In fact, all the people I see there seem to be tourists exploring the architecture---not actually going anywhere.  In the defence of the station, I should say I've only been there at weekends. How different is it during the working week?

Oh well, back to writing ...
