I thought it would be interesting to see the progress that the class, as a whole, is making. The table below summarises the 1s, 2s, and 3s awarded each week.

|         | Week 2   | Week 3   | Week 4   | Week 5   |
|---------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
| 1s      | 20       | 11       | 14       | 8        |
| 2s      | 12       | 14       | 13       | 12       |
| 3s      | 2        | 6        | 3        | 10       |
| Total   | 34       | 31       | 30       | 30       |

Two things stand out for me. Firstly, there is the trend as people start to get more 2s and 3s (and in particular, more 3s).

I feel I need to concentrate on helping those people who haven't participated much to get more chances to talk. So, I was wondering, would those people who often get 3s try not to talk until the second half of the class-today...
