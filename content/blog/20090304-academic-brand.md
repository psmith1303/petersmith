Does one need an academic brand that is independent from ones
current institution? [Some say yes.](https://academhack.outsidethetext.com/home/2009/academic-branding-and-portfolio-control/)
and it certainly shouldn't be like Facebook or LinkedIn.

Alas, I've yet to find a really good vehicle for maintaining my
teaching portfolio, research portfolio,_etc_.
