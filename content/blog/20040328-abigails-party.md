Last night, Lisa and I went to see _Abigail's Party_ at the [Maidment
Studio](https://www.maidment.auckland.ac.nz/). As the program says:

> North London, 1997---the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The
 Sex Pistols are gearing up to blow Donna Summer and Jose Feliciano out
 of the charts forever. The neighbours have been invited around for a
 few drinks, maybe a bit of dancing, and if you're lucky, light
 snobbery, relentless bullying and social humiliation.

Yes, it's a _get the guest_ play. I do enjoy those. Perhaps my chums
at [ATCP](https://www.psychodrama.org.nz/atcp.html)
will have some thoughts on that.

We really enjoyed the play. It was very well done.

Two of the players stand out for a special mention. Bernadette
Brewer played Beverly. She was wonderfully over the top, and her dress
was a feat of engineering. Also, Linda Johns was marvellous as Sue, the
divorced neighbour. Her timing and demeanour were perfect.

Whilst we were at the theatre, I bumped into Tony. He was in the first
cohort of the [BBIM](https://www.bbim.auckland.ac.nz/) at
[Tamaki](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/comwebContent/index.cfm?fs=pgv&pageid=8031).
I was surprised that I remembered his name as it has been over four
years since I taught him. He must have completed his degree and be in
the first graduating year of the BBIM. That
is a great achievement. _Well done, Tony_. I'll be looking forward to
seeing him cross the stage at the [graduation
ceremony](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/cir_students/index.cfm?action=display_page&page_title=studentadmin_graduation)
in May.

Anyway, he seems to be working for [Tech Site
Services](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/departments/techsite/index.cfm?fuseaction=rebuild&subaction=home),
so I guess the IM part of his degree is paying off.
