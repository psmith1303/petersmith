Whilst I was in hospital, or soon after, I heard a piece on the radio
about [errors](http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/GE0405/S00035.htm) in
prescription occurring at [ADHB](http://www.adhb.govt.nz/).

That doesn't surprise me after my experience. At one stage a
consultant insisted that my cholesterol was too high at 7---later
that day a registrar apologised and said it was actually, 3.9. At
one stage, I was told my treadmill test was inconclusive because I
was still taking beta-blockers (I've never taken beta-blockers). And,
on discharge, I was told to stop taking all of my prescribed heart
medication, but that I should continue taking my Losec
prescription. That was a surprise, as I wasn't taking taking and
hadn't been prescribed either heart medication or Losec.

I think the problem is one of pigeon-holing, as Mintzberg would say.
Because I didn't fit neatly into a standard pigeon-hole (not a heart
attack, not angina) they weren't quite sure what to do with me, or who'd be
responsible. So, the default came into play---back to the GP.  Actually, I have
the impression that the whole of the "High Dependency Unit' exists mainly as a
holding pen whilst patients are categorise (pigeon-holed) before being
dispatched to the "correct' location, e.g. The cardio ward,
Gastroenterology, etc.
