Well I'm making some progress on writing more here. I'm now using
[ScribeFire](http://www.scribefire.com/) as my publishing tool.
Hopefully, the fact that it is easier to "write' will encourage me to
do more writing.

I chose ScribeFire because it is often mentioned when
[Zotero]({{< relref "20080413-zotero.md" >}}) is
mentioned.

It actually took me several attempts to get ScribeFire to work.
What I didn't realize was that [Movable
Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) actually has a separate password
that is used for remote [xmlrpc](http://www.xmlrpc.com/) access.
