Over the years I've used a number of approaches to managing my
content.

- Hand crafted static HTML files static HTML using Frontpage and NetObjects
- PHP driven content
- Zope
- Movable Type

And now I'm using _Django_. And so far I'm pretty pleased, although I
would like to get WikiText (or something like it) working.
