Somewhat unexpectedly, the Dean, [Barry
Spicer](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/b.spicer) sent out an
email
to the faculty about "Changes at the Graduate School of Business". I
say unexpectedly, because tucked at the end of the email was the
following:

> _Peter Smith_, presently Lecturer in Strategy in the
Department of Management and Employment Relations, will take over the role of
Deputy Director of the MBA from 1 February 2005 as well as teaching in the MBA
programme. Peter has had significant business experience in Europe and is
himself a graduate of The Auckland MBA programme. He is also the recipient of a
distinguished teaching award.

Whilst this is entirely true, I didn't think it would be announced for
another week; and even then, I expected something more "low key'.
Anyway, what Barry failed to mentioned was the "why" behind my
decision. In essence, I am taking up a part-time role to allow me to
devote more time to my PhD. From my point of view it seems like a good
plan. Nevertheless, I do regret the work that others will have to
pick up (and prepare) for MGMT 301 and MGMT 302. On the plus side, I get
to spend more time
(and do more teaching) with MBA students.

I don't feel that I am leaving my current department. It is more of
a temporary _auf wiedersehen_ until we are all united in the [new
building](http://www.newschool.business.auckland.ac.nz/index.cfm).
So, after teaching summer school (MGMT 101,
Organisation & Management), I'll be off to
the GSB. Between now and then, I suspect
there is a fair bit of work-to-do.
