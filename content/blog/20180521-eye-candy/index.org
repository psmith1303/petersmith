There is, I believe, a lot of evidence that posts (be they on blogs
like this, or other social media such as Facebook). As places such
as [Edublogs](https://help.edublogs.org/add-images/) note that:

> Images grab your readers attention and encourage them to read your
> posts.

There are some suggestions that the effect can be
huge. [This page](https://blogging.com/images-and-photos/) suggests
that using images can "increase a blogs views by 95%" (whatever that
means).

Indeed, some folk, such as
the
[Social Media Examine](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SocialMediaMarketingIndustryReport2016.pdf) are
saying that images are not now enough and that videos are needed.

But often the images are little more than eye candy. They often only
tangentially relate to the topic being written about. For example,
today I was looking at the New Zealand Herald online, and article
entitled "Banks swamped by 'unprecedented increase' in credit card
fraud". The image used with the story is of a keyboard, a few credit
cards, and a combination padlock. Huh! 

As I roam around the web so many sites seem to be using stock images
to 'illustrate' their posts. But the images rarely add any value or
meaning to the post. They're just eye candy.

There are a raft to site giving advice, and software tools designed to
help you find images on the wild-wild-web, to illustrate your posts.
And there are also plenty of sites giving advice on how to use images
in posts. See for
example,
[this post](https://www.toprankblog.com/2016/01/images-social-media/).

But where is the information on choosing images that really add value.

I the past six months I have only used two images (besides the
infrequently updated posts of my runs which
have [maps](https://www.petersmith.org/running/)). The first image was
of
my [speed test results]({{< relref "20180521-faster-internet.md" >}})
after I upgrade my Internet connection. The second was a test of using
a image (that was very meaningful to me, but probably not to my
readers) related
to [writing]({{< relref "20180514-reflection.md" >}}). Is that enough,
or is it too much.

If the image matters, the content should seem less without it. So, in
one case, yes the image was good. In the other, I was just presenting
my readers with a bit of eye candy.
