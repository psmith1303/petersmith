We went and saw Chicago today at the Lido. If I haven't mentioned the [[https://www.lidocinema.co.nz/][Lido]] before I should say it is the best cinema in Auckland. It has the best coffee/leg-room/ice-cream/movies/staff/etc. I highly commend it to everyone. Oddly enough, in this day and age, it doesn't have a web site.

Anyway, back to the movie. It was very good and Lisa thinks that Ren&eacute; Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones will get Oscars for their performances. I particularly liked Lucy Liu character---a nice performance, albeit somewhat short. But was it better than the stage show. Well, being able to do two scenes at the same time worked well for the movie; but I preferred the stage show---it was more electric.
