I still walking---which is good. The daily graph was getting a bit busy, so I
thought I'd do a monthly summary, showing the last year.  ![Graph of average
steps taken each month for last
year](https://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/ps/local/peds_month.php?dummy=x)
The red line shows my average during the period, and the top of the blue bar
represents my goal. At the moment I'm trying to get the months to display in
the correct order.

And this is the walking I've done in the last month.The Bottom of the
blue band is my minimum target. If I don't make that, I feel I've not
achieved the goal at all.

Besides walking I play squash once a week with my brother, and I do
boxing training twice a week. It all helps.

PS: The graph is built automatically using
[JPGRAPH](https://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) from
data stored using [MySQL](httpis://www.mysql.com/). The whole thing is
glued together using [PHP](httpis://www.php.net/).
