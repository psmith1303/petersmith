One blog I always find myself going back to is by [Thomas
Basb%oslash;ll](https://www.cbs.dk/staff/basboll/%28language%29/dan-DK), who is
the Resident Writing Consultant at [Copenhagen Business
School](https://www.cbs.dk/cbs_international). He calls his blog
[Research as a second language](https://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/).

I was prompted to mention it now as I was reading his article [Free
Time, Blank Pages, and other Catastrophes](https://secondlanguage.blogspot.com/2009/12/free-time-blank-pages-and-other.html).

As I hurtle/stumble towards the end of my thesis, I find myself
wondering about the practices associated with "doing" a PhD. Here, at
the [University of Auckland Business](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/),
or at least in [this part of the Business
School](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/Schoolhome/ManagementInternationalBusiness/tabid/867/Default.aspx),
a thesis seems to be a largely individual exercise. And yet it doesn't
have to be that way. A colleague has some theses from a renowned Swedish
institution. The detailed structure of each PhD thesis is very similar
to each other ... down to the number of paragraphs per section. 

Clearly there has to be a greater level of congruence between practices there
than, say, where Saku Mantere did his
[thesis](https://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263297/) (which exhibits
some lovely ideosyncracies).
