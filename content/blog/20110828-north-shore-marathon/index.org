Today was the [North Shore
marathon](https://www.northshoremarathon.co.nz/). My overall time was
4:03:09 which placed me 48th overall and almost exact one hour behind
the best in my age group (3:03:40). I guess I have a bit of training to
do yet.

The race was harder than I expected. I hadn't studied the route to
well,
and so I was surprised to find that it went up [North
Head](https://g.co/maps/cqdat) and along the beach for 1 Km. That
wouldn't have been too bad, but as the marathon consisted of two laps I
had to do it twice. Oh, well; I'll know for next time.

However, one of my goals was not to over do it, as I am flying out to
the UK today. And that goal has been well met. Because of timezone
differences, I found myself walking around San Francisco for many hours
today with no aches and pains from the run.

So, whilst I didn't break four hours, I didn't break myself either.

Now its time to continue working on my prep for the Auckland Marathon.
