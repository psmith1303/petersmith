[Here](https://www.business.auckland.ac.nz/) we tend to use
[nVivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx) for
[qualitative research/analysis](https://www.qual.auckland.ac.nz/). It's
pretty robust, but the handling of [PDF
files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) leaves
a
lot to be desired. What nVivo seems to do is to convert the PDF into
some sort of RTF-like format. Unfortunately the fidelity of the
converted file isn't that good. In fact, it can be darn difficult to
work with most converted files if they are anything more than
plain-old-text.

The problem is so bad, and I am so keen to analyse/work with PDF files
I'm thinking of changing to [Atlas/ti](https://www.atlasti.com/). That
programme handles PDF files in their native format ... there is no loss
of fidelity when working with them.

What I can't decide is whether the learning curve/downtime is worth the
change.
