We went to the Cock and Bull for a traditional Sunday roast today. It
was yummy. I was a little surprised how empty the pub was. But then
again there are a few things on in town today, such as the cricket.

The implications of loosing all the data in my Palm pilot are just
sinking in. The only address book I ever had was a little red one, that
I got when I left school. Many years ago (about 10), I transferred all
the names and address that I had in that address book to some software
from [Time Manager International](https://www.tmiworld.com/). That
information (plus some) was moved to Outlook, and then eventually
to my Palm pilot. I kept backups for ages, but a series of events
(starting with the upgrade of this machine, has led to the total loss
of everything ... Oy, vey!
