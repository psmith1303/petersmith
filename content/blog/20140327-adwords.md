During [Ekant Veer's](https://www.facebook.com/ekant) [talk yesterday
on
using social media to get exposure for ones
research]({{< relref "20140326-the-use-of-social-media.md" >}}),
it occurred to me than many companies are much further down that path
than those in academia.

Some of those organizations have found it more efficacious to use
AdWords---to get in front of people as a result of their searching
activity, rather than build up a large(ish) footprint on the web.

So, how would it be if, for example, I put together a campaign using
keywords from the domain I'm interested in: social practices,
Jarzabkowski, strategy-as-practice, and other similar expressions.
Would I get much attention from those people interested in social practices
and the like?
