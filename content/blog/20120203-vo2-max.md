If you're serious about training for a sport, it can be really helpful
to know you [VO2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max) and your
[lactate
threshold](http://www.sport-fitness-advisor.com/lactate-threshold.html).

So, I'm off the University of Auckland's ["Health and Performance
Clinic"](http://www.clinics.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/our-services/health-and-performance/).
They are doing a special (until 1 March 2012), whereby you can get
either test done for just $50 (the price of the consumables).

But it gets better, if I can get 20 people to do it, then the cost will
only be $45 for each test. How good is that.

When you book (on 09 923 2541) just mention mention ["Daily
Mile"](http://www.dailymile.com/people/PeterSmith) or ["Andrew is
Getting fit"](http://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/).
