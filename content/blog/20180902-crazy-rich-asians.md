After a rather busy week, and a busy day in town, we decided to kick
back and relax by going to see [Crazy Rich
Asians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/). It had gotten some
good reviews by [Simon and
Kermode](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj) so we were pretty
sure we were on to a good thing.

Correct! It was really good romp with excellent performances and it
more than passed the "five laughts" test. Best comedy of the year, so far.

Constance Wu was great in the lead, and Gemma Chan (Mia in the series
Humans). But for me Awkwafina stole the show; her character (Peik Lin
Goh) was priceless.

All in all, a good laugh.
