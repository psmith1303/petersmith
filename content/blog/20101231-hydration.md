It's hot. Darn hot. Looking at the comments from my [street
team](https://runkeeper.com/user/Peter_Smith/streetTeam) at
[RunKeeper](https://runkeeper.com/) the heat plays an import role in how
they feel about their runs.

I know that even after a 10Km run, or so, in this weather I'm quite
thirsty. And then there are my long (20-35Km) runs. Even before summer
arrived, I would drink a litre or two at the end of my run. But no more
(I hope). I've invested in a [Camelbak Octane XCT](https://www.camelbak.com/en/sports-recreation/run/2011-octane-xtc.aspx).

With two litres of water, that should make my long runs more
comfortable. And yes, I did get the bright yellow one ... it was all I
could find in the Boxing Day sales.

My first real trial of the pack will be on Sunday when I'm planning to
do a 24Km run. That's also when I hope to get a blow-by-blow of
[Andrew's](https://www.andrewisgettingfit.com/) recent outing at the
Taipei Marathon.
