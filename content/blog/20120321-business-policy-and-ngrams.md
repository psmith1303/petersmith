Much has been written about the change from _business policy_ to
_business strategy_ (aka strategic management). I thought it would be
interesting to look at that change over time. So, searching [Google's
corpus of ngram books](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) I've tracked
the rise and fall of business policy and business strategy.

You can use business policy and strategic management, but you'll get a very
similar result. I think the result is what one might expect. The chart
is based on the "American English" collection of books. What is
interesting is the result when you look at the same terms using the
"British" collection of books.

There is still a big rise in "business strategy" from the 1980s, but the
surge in "business policy in the 1920s is entirely missing. It's true that
business policy emerged from the Harvard Business School around
1910--1920, but the size is---in retrospect---a little surprising perhaps,
as is the way the idea doesn't materially travel to Britain.
