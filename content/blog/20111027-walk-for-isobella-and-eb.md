I'm running the Auckland Marathon on Sunday. I'm looking forward to it, and it
should be fun. A few weeks later, I'll be in
[Kerikeri](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=kerikeri&hl=en&sll=37.0625,--95.677068&sspn=62.057085,62.490234&vpsrc=0&hnear=Kerikeri,+Northland,+New+Zealand&t=m&z=11)
running the [KeriKeri half
marathon](https://www.runwalkseries.co.nz/default.asp?PageID=22925).

I'm doing the run at KeriKeri to raise awareness about Epidermylosis Bullosa
and to raise money for Debra New Zealand, a [support group for sufferers of
EB](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Walk-for-Isobella-EB/201005623259849?sk=info)
and their families. Most of the information here, I've taken from the [Walk for
Isobella and
EB](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Walk-for-Isobella-EB/201005623259849) pages.

> Epidermolysis Bullosa is medical Latin for skin that blisters and
> tears easily. _Epidermal_ describes "outer skin layers'; _lysis_ means
> "tearing and shearing'; and the _Bulla_ are the "blisters' that
> develop.
>
> If you have EB then your skin is more delicate, it blisters or tears
> more easily. In severe EB the slightest touch can cause skin to
> blister or come off and leave wounds like burns. It's as if there's no
> glue between the skin and the tissue below. It can also occur in the
> mucous membranes, particularly inside the mouth and throat causing
\> major issues with nutrition.
>
> There are three main types of EB --- _Dystrophic, Simplex-_ an\_d
> Junctional.\_ Each type can be mild or severe, and each is made up of
> many different sub-types. In fact just about everyone living with EB
> is affected differently.
>
> The type of EB relates to where weakness occurs in the skin cell
> layers.
>
> - _Dystrophic EB_ skin comes apart at the bottom layer.Coming
> "unglued' down near the flesh below, amongst the live basal skin
> cells. With live regenerative cells lost, wounds have to heal
> growing in from the sides. Dystrophic EB also affects the body's
> internal skin. Dystrophic means scarring.
> - _Simplex EB_ skin comes apart in the upper layers.Wound healing is
> "simpler' with a full compliment of live cells still in the right
> place to fix the wound with less scarring. Simplex EB can be worse
> when the weather is hot and humid.
> - _Junctional EB_ skin comes apart at the "junction' between the
> upper layer and the live lower cells. Surprisingly these wounds
> can take the longest to heal.
>
> More than 150 New Zealanders have this genetic disorder. While most
> have mild to moderate symptoms, many require specialist and ongoing
> clinical care to varying degrees.
>
> Currently 11 New Zealanders live with severe EB, which has an
> incidence of 1 in 300,000.

At KeriKeri many people will be walking to raise money. Me, I'll be
running ... that's what I do.

I'm doing this to raise money, because a dear friend's niece had the
worst form of this, and only lived six weeks. So, if you'd like to
_sponsor me_ (whatever the amount), please contact me.

To my colleagues, many of whom have sponsored me at $105 each (21k at
$5), thank you. To Thomas and Andrew, who have sponsored me at $2
per K, rising to $4 per K if I complete in under 1:40, and rising to $8
per K ($168) if I do it under 1:35, a special thanks---you know how to
motivate me.
