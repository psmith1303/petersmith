Well, I was wrong. [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/][Kill Bill: Volume 2]] isn't on here yet. So instead we went and saw [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335438/][Starsky & Hutch]].  Nice touch having [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815800/][David Soul]] and [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001274/][Paul Michael Glaser]] make cameo appearances.

I didn't recognise [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000496/][Juliette Lewis]] (who played Kitty) until I saw the end credits.

Huggy Bear was played by Snoop Dogg (is that how you spell it?). Not the greatest of actors.

All in all, I'd give the movie a thumbs up---well worth a trip to the video store (or the cinema).
