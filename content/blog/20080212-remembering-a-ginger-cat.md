Ginger (born 6 Oct 1997), gone but not forgotten.

- Coming home from the Humane Society in a photocopier paper box (with Fred)
- The first catch---earth worms.
- The great expedition (with Fred)---walking along the fence and into other gardens. Tails held high.
- Confusion---catching a fly and not knowing what to do with it.
- Going though the cat-flaps at full speed---bang! bang!
- Running into the closed ranch sliders.
- Eating biscuits with such vigour that they explode in his mouth and go everywhere.
- Sleeping on Lisa's head.
- Jumping of the dresser on to the bed.
- Sleeping in the laundry (or the clean cloths).
- Digging in the litter tray (in the middle of the night, for what seems like ages)
- Chasing a piece of rope around and around the garden.
- Helping to make the bed, by playing under the sheets.
- Sleeping on my tummy whilst watching TV
- Trying to fit into any box (regardless of how small)---harking back to his kitten days.
- Sleeping in Lisa's in-tray
- Watching the world go by from his basket on the deck.
- His tiny front teeth
- Nudging hard when he wants-food
