I've just opened the flood-gates [[{{< relref "20040309-opening-the-floodgates" >}}][again]] and sent out an email with the login details for Net Mike. One thing I'm [[{{< relref "20040402-mikes-bikes-message-board" >}}][interested]] in is the way in which people use the messaging board of Net Mike. I wonder how (or if) it will be used this time.

Here I'm trying to make a deliberate link between the current class and past classes. We have a long history in MGMT 301, and we're experimenting with how we can make better connection between the semesters for students. In the future, we hope that sharing the company cases will do that, but for now, I'm just trying to create some sense of history for the class.
