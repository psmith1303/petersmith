Meanwhile, back to the "petit plaisir' of the day (and every day), shaving.

A long time ago, I used to use Gillette shaving foam. Then I went to Gillette
shaving gels. I had a long affair with Clinique's shaving gel.  Very nice. $28
a pop, duty free. Then it was back to Gillette shaving gels.

But now I'm using a double-edge razor, I've used (and am using) a variety of
shaving creams.

[Taylor's of Old Bond Street](https://www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk/): Very nice. I
certainly would use this again. Not much is needed for a really excellent
lather.

[Edwin Jagger](https://www.edwinjagger.co.uk/) ((Sandalwood): Good.  Reminiscent
of ToOBS

[Ted Barker](https://www.tedbaker.com): Okay ... I like the dispenser, but the
cream itself is just okay

L'Ocittane (Cade): One of my first creams. Solid, but I probably won't go back
to it.

[Truefitt & Hill](https://www.truefittandhill.co.uk)(Number 10): My faviourite
so far. So little is needed, and the lather is so good. I'm keeping this for
special occasions. I wish I could remember where I bought it from. Was it in
the UK; I'm not sure. I'm keen to try some of their more expensive products.

[Proraso](https://www.proraso.it/) (original): Yet to be tried, but I like the
eucalyptus and menthol smell.

I've not tried any shaving soaps. It seems like a lot of work to get a good
lather together. Some folk report spending 10 minutes working up a lather.
That's too much time for me. So, I'll be sticking with shaving creams for a
while I think.
