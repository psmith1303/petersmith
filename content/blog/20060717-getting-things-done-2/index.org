I've been a fan of [[https://www.davidco.com/][David Allen's]] system for /getting things done/ or GTD for some time.

Up until know, I've been using the [[https://gtdsupport.netcentrics.com/buy/][add-on]] for Outlook. It's worked pretty well, although I have experienced some instability with Outlook (but then again, who hasn't).

I'm spent a bit of time over the weekend rehashing [[https://davidavraamides.net/blog/2006/07/30/getting-things-done-django-style-part-2/][David Avraamides's]] code to work for me. It's been fun making the changes I've needed (mainly cosmetic), but is seems reliable enough for me to move all of my tasks out of Outlook.

It's also been a great opportunity to tidy up and generally sort out my tasks. After a while some crud does collect in there. That's probably because I don't do my weekly reviews the way I should.
