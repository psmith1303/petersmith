After [[https://petersmith.org/blog/2021/10/07/first-steps-to-indieweb/][my first steps to IndieWeb]], I got a really helpful message from [[https://robbinespu.gitlab.io/][Robbi Nespu]]. Alas, I've not (yet) got webmentions working in any real way, and the page he commented on had a broken URL (all my problems, not Robbi's).

He said:

Hello Peter Smith, How going? I also using Hugo, the getting webmention response working is easier if using a javascript called as [[https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/][PlaidWeb/webmention.js]]

Some tips from my experience

- Setup the ~h-card~ because it important and needed for indieAuth (to use some external services such as [[https://webmention.io][https://webmention.io]]
- You may use [[https://xray.p3k.io][https://xray.p3k.io]] to inspect if the HTML are parse correctly, you can submit the URL or just paste the raw HTML (even with ~localhost~ / ~127.0.0.1~ addressed inside the source code, it working very well). It save my time during debugging.
- I also use [[https://telegraph.p3k.io][https://telegraph.p3k.io]] to preview (check) if all link inside ~h-entry~ support webmention. You also can manually send webmention by give a source and target from there.
- Lastly, validate published web using [[https://indiewebify.me/]]  get your website until level 3.

Hope this helpful ðŸ˜€

So, what's my progress so far? (beside's Robbi's smiley face emoji not displaying correctly in emacs)

- Level 1: Become a citizen of the IndieWeb
  1. Get your own domain name: Done. Many years ago.
  2. Set up Web Sign In: That was easy. Or it was until I decided to not use ~<link rel="me" href= ..../>~. And once I had that working I too the time to break it again.

- Level 2: Publishing on the IndieWeb
  1. Check your homepage h-card: I really should read the specs more closely. I bashed my head against a brick wall for a while with this. Even though I used bits of HTML from [[https://aaronparecki.com/][Aaron Parecki]] and from [[https://boffosocko.com/][Chris Aldrich]], it still took too much time.
  2. Check your posts are marked up with ~h-entry~: Not so hard, although I have had to tweak the layout of may pages somewhat. Categories, aren't elegant yet.

- Level 3: Add the ability to send Webmentions to other IndieWeb sites

This is a work in progress. I can do it manually using, say, [[ttps://telegraph.p3k.io][https://telegraph.p3k.io]] but I've yet to automate things. The bigger challenge is getting other people's Webmentions to appear on my site.

/Update 2022-01-09/

I have just figured out that the posting Robbi did was to a page whose URL was broken; The page should have been [[https://petersmith.org/blog/2021/10/07/first-steps-to-indieweb/]] and not  https://petersmith.org/blog/2021/10/10/20211010-first-steps-to-indieweb/ (notice the extra date in the slug of the posting).

That little problem has been fixed but it does mean his posting doesn't point anyway (for now) --- but I'll fix that in my next update to the blog (using [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases][Hugo's ability to have aliases]]).

The bigger problem is that the code I am writing to display webmentions would be horribly complicated by dealing with aliases. I cannot see an straightforward way to do that. Sorry [[https://robbinespu.gitlab.io/][Robbi]] â˜¹
