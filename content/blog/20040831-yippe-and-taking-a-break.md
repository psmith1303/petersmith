I've had had a letter from the [Graduate
Centre](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/postgraduate/) that says I:
>
>  have satisfactorily completed the goals approved when you were
initially registered. Accordingly your registration is confirmed.
Yippee. I'm fully registered at last. Now to complete the _damn
thing_.

However, as I've said
[elsewhere]({{< relref "20040508-a-wake-up-call.md" >}})
I need to ease back a little. As part of that process I've decided to suspend
my PhD studies for a while (until March). That should give me time enough to
get things back on track.  So, the same letter said they have accepted my
suspension of my PhD studies for six months. So, 40-hour weeks, here I come
(and that is a novelty).
