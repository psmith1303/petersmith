Lisa, my darling wife, and I went and saw the latest play at the Silo
theatre. It's call [The Women](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032143/),
and it's by the outspoken congresswoman [Clare Booth
Luce](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/wcf/wcf0010.html). Written about 70
years ago, I can imagine it was considreed risque in its day.
The latest edition of [The Listener](https://www.thelistener.co.nz/)
magazine gives ten quotes by Clare Booth Luce, and these give a sense
of her progressive attitudes:

1. Nature abhors a virgin---a frozen asset.
2. I'm in my ancedotage.
3. I don't have a warm personal enemy left. They've all died off. I
miss them terribly because they helped define me.
4. Lying increases the creative faculties, expands the ego, and
lesses the frictions on social contact.
5. Communism is the opiate of the intellectuals with no cure
except as a guillotine might be called a cure for dandruff.
6. No good deed goes unpunished.
7. There is nothing like a good does of another woman to make a man
appreciate his wife.
8. All autobiographies are alibi-ographies.
9. A man's home may be his castle on the outside; inside, it is more
other his nursery.
10. Censorship, like charity, should begin at home, but unlike
charity, it should end there.

Actually, a couple of these seem familiar and might actually be lines
from the play.

Anyway, the eight women actors play an astonishing number of characters
([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) says 130, but that seems too many). The dialogue
is witty and fast moving; however the skill (as Lisa told me), is the way in
which the plot is slowly revealed. I really enjoyed it.  The whole caste were
good, and notable performances were turned in by _Anna Hutchison_ (ex Shortland
Street), _Hannah Tolich_ (also, ex Shortland Street), and _Lucy Wigmore_ (yes,
another from Shortland Street---is there anyone in New Zealand theatreland who
hasn't been on that show?).

Given the size of the theatre, I was surprised to see that the
performance was done "in the round' and it worked really well. I do
like the intimacy of the Silo, and this made it even more intimate.
All, in all, a big thumbs up for _The Women_.
