I had another fitness assessment at the university's---[Recreation-
Centre](https://www2.auckland.ac.nz/recreation/) today. Here are
the results.

Overall, my weight loss has plateaued  but I'm definitely fitter. I
think I need to adjust my diet somewhat. It'll be interesting to see
what the doctor says next. Most-interestingly-was how poorly I did on
the sit ups---my boxing training has done a lot to improve on my "abs'
but it didn't show on today's test. I'll have to think about that (is
it the test itself?).

Anyway, the results were:


|   |   | Comments|
|---|--:|-------|
| Weight | 99.08 | No change |
| Height | 176 | I've grown...nearly 3 cm |
| Blood pressure |  Not done | |
| Resting-pulse rate | 60 beats/minute | That's an-improvement--- it's down from 70 bpm |
| _Body composition_ | | |
| Triceps | 24mm | Same |
| Subscapular | 37mm | Same |
| Suprapsinal | 26mm | Big drop from 41mm. So, I'm losing fat from somewhere. Maybe it's getting converted |into muscle---how else do I explain my weight plateauing |
| Medial calf | 27mm | Same |
| Sum of skin folds | 114mm | Down |
| Hip to waist | 0.92 | Was 1.02---I'm now in the moderate group.  That makes my body-fat content 25%, down from over 30% |
| _Astrand Submaximal Cycle Erometer test_ | | |
| Estimated-VO2-Max | 33 | Better. The fair range is 31---39 |
| _Flexibility_ | | |
| Sit-&-reach | Very good | |
| Thomas test | Left quad a little tighter than the right, hip flexors good | |
| Shoulder-assessment | Okay | |
| _Strength_ | | | 
| Push ups | 19 | Well that is over double, but not quite in the "good' range (21---30)|
| Sit ups | 9 | Fair ... argh! I've been working hard and I expected more |

Of course, this is all age dependent.
