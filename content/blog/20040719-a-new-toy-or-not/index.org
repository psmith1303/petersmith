During lunch, I walked down to Tisdall's and brought a new
[[https://www.silva.se/outdoor/products/acce_pedstep.htm][pedometer]]. I
lost mine yesterday somewhere in between going in to School to watch the
[[https://www.bostonconsulting.com.au/chapterstarters/strategy.html][BCG
case]] teams present. I do like to know that I'm getting [enough
"peds]({{< relref "20040616-walking.md" >}}) in. Any it's lost, so I
brought a new one... I'm still sticking with the
[[https://www.silva.se/][Silva]] brand. They (Lisa's used them before)
are pretty reliable. If they have one problem, it's that they can fall
off your belt when getting into a car (or similar). I think that's what
happened to my old one. So, I'll be getting my toolbox out and making a
few modifications to this one.

So, the steps keep racking up.
