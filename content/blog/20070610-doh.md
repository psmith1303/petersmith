From time to time, I find myself using some words too frequently. When
this happens I turn to Word's thesaurus (good old F7).

Today, I unleashed the awesome power of Microsoft on "broad', and was
rewarded with:

> Minor road, byroad side street, lane

WTF? Then Lisa points out, I'm using the
English thesaurus, and Word thinks I'm talking about a B-road (as
opposed to main, or A-roads, such as the A1).

What is odd, is that it doesn't list all the other meanings of broad.

Switching to the US thesaurus gives me more of what I expected.

Now, I wonder what the mechanism is to let Microsoft know of this
feature---or will it remain forever causing English writers to
say-_Doh!_
