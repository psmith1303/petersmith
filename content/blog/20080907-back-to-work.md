Having spent a lot of the weekend sorting out the styles and
templates for the blog, I think it's about time to get back to work;
i.e., the
[PhD]({{< relref "20080907-phd-topic.md" >}}).

However, before I abandon this "diversion' I thought I'd make a few
notes about what still might need to be done on the site:

- The main page of the blog just lists the ten, or so, most recent
posts. At the bottom of the page there is a link to the site's
archives. I wonder if I need something upfront, such as a search box,
to allow people to find old material more easily.
- I've done away entirely with the sidebar. That gives the page a
cleaner look, but it doesn't invite people to explore more of the site.
- Finally, I've started using the hierarchical categories. I had
planned to do this earlier. But, having now installed the latest
version of the (software](http://www.movabletype.com/), it's been so
easy to do. Now I'm wondering if I should use tags as well as
categories.

I'm amazed at my capacity to get distracted by something. Such as
fixing these templates and styles. I could easily spend much more
time doing this. But at the end of the day, I wouldn't be moving
forwards on what is really important; my teaching and my research.

Actually, it has taken me less time than I expected to do the changes
I -needed- wanted to make. That's all down to
[Google's](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) new web browser
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome). It's a slick and tidy piece of
software. I would make it my main browser except that it doesn't (yet)
support _ad blocking_, and two essential
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) add-ins (
[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) and [libx](http://www.libx.org/)) aren't
available for it (Oh, and it isn't yet available for
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/).

Anyway, Chrome has this really neat feature that allows you to
inspect elements of a web page to see which parts of your stylesheet
are "active'. Without this, I would have spent a lot more time
tweaking the site's CSS.

And now, back to the salt mine.

_Update_
[Andrew](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/StaffDirectory/StaffProfile/tabid/542/upi/aebe001/Default.aspx)
pointed me towards
[CSSViewer](http://www.nicolashuon.info/?page=work&type=projects&id=cssviewer).
This neat
[add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=2104&application=firefox) for
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) shows what the CSS is
for a particular element on the screen.

Google's Chrome inspector shows which parts of the style sheet is being
used (or overridden) so it is easier to tweak one's style-sheet.
