Still at the [[https://www.nzff.telecom.co.nz][festival]] ... This movie is a semi-autobiographical piece by [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001290/][Richard E. Grant]] recounts a his life in Swaziland. Not only did he write the screen play, but he also produced and directed it. Apparently, his real mother (played in the movie by [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001669/][Miranda Richardson]]) thought is was a good movie too (if I remember the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio5/][Five Live]] interview). There is some really fine acting in this movie. I particular enjoyed seeing [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001833/][Emily Watson]] as Ruby---but the whole cast was pretty good.

Oddly, the cinematography of Swaziland (I think it was filmed there) reminded me of the [[https://www.wairarapanz.com/][Wairarapa]] on a hot summer's day. But then, I've often thought that the Wairarapa was a bit like the African veld (and yes, I've never been to the African veld, but I have been to the Wairarapa).

Overall, four out of five stars.
