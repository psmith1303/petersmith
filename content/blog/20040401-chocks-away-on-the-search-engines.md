For many years, my robots.txt file has barred ever robot from the site.  Well
that has changed now. So now I'm sitting back waiting for
[Google](http://www.google.com), [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com), and all the
other engines to start coming.  I'm fascinated by who comes to the site, so the
[web stats package](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/) behind the site is quiet
comprehensive. But, it is also interesting to see how people get here from the
various search engines. Enter
[Zeitgeist](http://twiki.tensegrity.net/bin/view/Main/SearchReferralZeitgeist).
In case you didn't know, when you use an search engine to find a site, when you
click the link to go to a site, the details of the search you used is sent to
the site you're going to. Does that make sense? Maybe an example will help.

If you go to [Google](http://www.google.com) and search for [BBIM
psychodrama](http://www.google.com/search?q=BBIM+psychodrama) you end up with
one link to [The Reflective
Practitioner](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org).  When you click the
link on Google for here, the details of you search (BBIM psychodrama) come with
you. Every few hours Zeitgeist checks the logs here and builds a [Zeitgeist
page](http://www.thereflectivepractitioner.org/zietgeist.html) which show the
search terms people used to find the site. At the moment it is largely rubbish,
as it is the result of my trying the technology out. But over time it should be
pretty reliable.  All I need know is those search engines to come and index the
complete site (at the moment they have only done the first "page').  In case
you're interested Google has it's own "Zeitgeist
page":http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html, so you can see what are the
current "hot" search terms.
