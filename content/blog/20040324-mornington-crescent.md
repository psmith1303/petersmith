[Darl](http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/dkolb) and I have spent sometime
talking about the game of [Mornington Crescent](http://www.dunx.org/mc/) ((For
details of the real basis of Mornington Crescent have a look at
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Crescent))). In particular,
I've been thinking about it in relation to David Boje's [Stories of the
Storytelling Organization: A postmodern analysis of Disney as
Tamara-Land'](http://cbae.nmsu.edu/\~dboje/papers/DisneyTamaraland.html).  From
recollection, [Boje's](http://cbae.nmsu.edu/\~dboje/) thesis (in the article)
is that organisations can been seen as a collection of concurrent, and
competing stories. Perhaps, for some people in some organisations, rather than
playing out stories, they are actually playing out games of Mornington
Crescent---games where the rules are wholly unclear (and possibly
misunderstood).

Perhaps if we view organisations attempts at strategy as games of
Mornington Crescent, that might explain why there is such
contradictory evidence for the efficacy of strategy (( There
probably should be a reference here.)).

By the way, did you know that David Boje's current
[university](http://www.nmsu.edu) is one of the greatest centres of
research on chilli plants?
