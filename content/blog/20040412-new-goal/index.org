I've set myself a target of reading and documenting (here) one article or book a day. I might read more than that; but the 'kicker' is to actually write them up. So, the first one is due now!  The idea is to force me to be more reflective in my reading.

/Update:/ Well normally it takes me a couple of hours to read and article and to "inwardly digest it'. So far, it's taken over five hours to read the article and put my thoughts (and key points) down. Thank heavens it's not a
term paper.

/Update, Update:/ Well that took too long. I need to be more efficient than that.
