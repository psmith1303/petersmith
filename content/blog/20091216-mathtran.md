Sometimes, it is really necessary to display a complex formula; such as
this:

![Mathtran](https://www.mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=textstyle%20Delta%20x%20%2CDelta%20p_x%20ge%20hbar/2)

I use [MathTran](https://www.mathtran.org/) to achieve this, rather than
doing a complex server-side install of Latex. Then I can use a URL like
the one below to dynamically display the equation above:

    https://www.mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=textstyle Delta x %2CDelta p_x ge hbar/2\

That reminds me, there is a [Google API](https://code.google.com/apis/chart/) for doing charts on the fly.  The simple example they give is:

![Hello world example](https://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&chd=t:60,40&chs=250x100&chl=Hello|World)

Although much more complex graphs ((Thanks to
https://www.felipebarone.com/plot-function-google.php [now defunct] for
this example)) are possible:
