There was an interesting session today by [Ekant
Veer](https://www.facebook.com/ekant) on the application of social media in
getting one's research 'out there' and recognised. It was an interesting
session.

To that end, I'm trying to link my blog to both Twitter and Facebook ...
so lets see what happens when I try and publish this.

_Update_: Well I never quite managed to get round to do that linking.
