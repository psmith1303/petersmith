After yesterday's 500-mile drive (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama to Georgia) it was nice to give the legs a bit of workout. 

Aside from the first 3/4 Km this really was a road runner. Few pavements and a lot of traffic. But there was on other runner out and about (caught that rabbit). Lots of long waits at the traffic lights ... this is a serious highway.
