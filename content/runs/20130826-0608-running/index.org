That was hard and not in a good way. After last weeks long run (29k) I felt I could easily keep on going for another 10k :)

This week I could barely finish. My legs were shot; especially my quads. No reason for it that I can think of. I didn't go out too fast; indeed I was a little slower than last week (for, say, the first 10k). 

By 24k I was felling really beat. 

And that shouldn't have been the case. This week I was practicing 'fully loaded'. I had all my nutrition (2 gels) and hydration (1.5l of water laced with Horley's). So, I don't think I was 'bonking'. 

Right hip a bit niggly, but no worse than last week. 

I think I'll just write this one off to being character building. 

As I didn't break at 5:00 pace on this one, I'll need to do four sub-5:00 runs this week to get my Roadr
