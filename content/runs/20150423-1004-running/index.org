After having Kat put me through my workout paces, I hooked up with Andrew for this run. 

The plan was a gentle run to Mt Eden, power up the Mt, cruise back doing on set on sprints in the park. 

Gentle run: tick.
Power up the Mt: tick.  OMG my heart rate was at about 170 all the way up (Lactate threshold for me is 165). I could nearly breath let alone talk. 
Cruise back: tick
Sprint: no way. I was stuffed and that would have been asking for an accident. 

So, I'm sure the back to back strength and run sessions are good for me, but they take it out of me.
