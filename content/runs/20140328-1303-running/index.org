Stunningly good day. Went for a run (YUPPY trail running) in the Domain. The ground is pretty dry and I thought to myself, "Wow, the ground is hard!"  Then I ran on the pavement and realised just how hard and unforgiving concrete is. 

On the last bit of the run I zigzagged down a grassy hill. I wonder how the GPS coped with that. 

All in all, a lovely end to the working week's runs.
