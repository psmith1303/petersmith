This run was also rather 'flat', but I think I have worked out why. 

Over Christmas I drifted away from my high protein-low carb diet. My waistline can confirm that. So my body readapted to running off mainly carbs (so to speak). Yesterday, was pretty much a carb free day, and today I've only had a couple of eggs. 

So, I think I kind of ran out of fuel 

This brings home to me the need to gt back on track with my diet.
