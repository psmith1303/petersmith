If it is Wednesday, then it's the Shoe Science run. That means a 5k warm-up to get there, 5k-ish group run, and a 1k trot home. 

Warm. Maybe even hot. Ran much of the course with Aaron from SportsLab. I probably went out a wee bit too fast ... but it was going up Mt Eden that really slowed me up. 

But overall fun. Missed out on the spot prize of a pair of Vibram Five Fingers. Is that good or bad :)
