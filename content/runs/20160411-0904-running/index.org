Well I missed the rain, but even so, the grass in the Domain was pretty damp. 

I'm trying to run with constant effort. I should start wearing my heart rate monitor to check that.  My training plan is to keep doing 5 Km runs until I am routinely (and easily) exceeding my marathon pace; I.e., sub-5:00 min/Km. I'll then start increasing my distance ... well add in some longer runs. Once I can comfortably do 21 km again, speed work will come to the fore. 

The idea is not to change my training load too much in too many directions. It would be crazy for me to start doing hills, speed-work, and distance-work all at the same time. 

Today's run felt okay.
