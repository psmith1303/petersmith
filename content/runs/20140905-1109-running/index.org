Come Election Day, I hope to be running around Madrid. So, this run is all about going to vote early. 

Stopped off at Allpress at the turnaround for a single origin brew (coffee). They give away these great plastic phone bags (for when it gets wet). 

And I needed that bag too. It hosed down on the way back (that's a meteorological term). 

All good as @maurice tends to say.
