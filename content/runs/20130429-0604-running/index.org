Ran 11.2k in 55:40 and felt good. 

Some tightness in my back, but okay overall. 

They are digging up the pavement in Mt Eden. So I found myself doing the urban version of trail running. Ho, ho, ho. 

Perfect weather for running.  

Almost overtaken by a whippet toward the end of the run. But I turned up the dial and we ran and talked together until we had to head off in different directions.
