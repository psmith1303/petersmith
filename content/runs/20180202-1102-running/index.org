I’m not sure my heart rate would agree, but this was a steady effort run. Got a bit warm towards the end. That is a change from yesterday’s wet and windy weather. 

My right knee felt a bit wobbly for the first few hundred meters. Then it was fine until the last half kilometre, when it felt a bit achy. 

Okay walking afterwards :)
