Ran 11k in 59:16 and felt like I had worked!

If you follow the link to my detailed Runmeter results, you'll see my HR and what an effort I was putting in at times. 

After a month of very fractured training, my fitness has slid back a bit. 

My short (5k or less) performance isn't too bad---witness the past two day's effort on the treadmill. 

But it's all good really as I'm ahead of median time on this route :)
