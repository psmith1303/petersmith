My last long run in Oxford. I pretty much followed the route of my first long run here, back in July!

A bit fatigued; I don't often do back-to-back running days. And after yesterday's effort ...

I've enjoyed my running in Oxford, and I've particularly enjoyed running with the Headington Road Runners.
