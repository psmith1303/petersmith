I should have worn my contact lenses for this run. The rain slowly increased until I couldn't see clearly through my glasses (by about 2/3 of the route). 

Heart rate was a bit high, considering my pace. But it's a fast-day (meaning I've only had coffee as a source of carbs). So I guess my body was working a bit harder to convert fat into something more useful.
