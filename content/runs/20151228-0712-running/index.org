Pheww. Pretty sunny out there. There was pretty good cloud cover at the start of the run, but it was burnt off quickly; by the end of the run there were clear blue skies. 

Very quiet around town. Jus a couple of other runners. I could have run down the centre of K' Road and been safe from traffic---in fact I did for a bit. 

None of the local coffee roasters are open. That might be (1st world) problem as we are getting low on beans. 

A pleasant run. Pace okay. Hammy 1/10. Working on getting my hips tilting forward a bit.
