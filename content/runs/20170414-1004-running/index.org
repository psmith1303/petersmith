Ran 9.2 km in 47:43 minutes and felt good

Looking at my route, I almost went "balls out".  In reality, I tried to pick up the pace in the kilometres 3, 4, and 5 ... but for me it hard to sustain the effort. 

This started off as a 7 km run, but I miscalculated and it turned into 9 km. I'll have to watch that next week. 

It was pretty sunny when I set off. Little evidence of cyclone Cook. The moment I stopped running it began to rain. The joy of Auckland's changeable weather.
