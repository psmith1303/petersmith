It was hot this morning with a prediction of rain for the afternoon. So I held off running until later in the day and was blessed with a continuous light misting of rain throughout my 'expedition'. 

Okay, it was a short run, but I felt in the zone. Very nice. 

I'm listening to "The diamond age" by Neal Stephenson. Rather good methinks.
