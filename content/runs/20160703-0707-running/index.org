My last run in Montreal and what a cracker of a morning for it. Decided to run up Mont Royal again ... and again I thought of all the mountain goats I know; Matt, Nic, Lisa, Mark, the list goes on. What an inspiration you guys are!

So, after 3 days if back to back running, my running schedule is going to be a bit erratic as I'm travelling for the next couple of weeks. But I have a plan, so I should be able to keep my progress going. 

Now to do some packing.
