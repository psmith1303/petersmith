A gentle test of my right calf. Seems okay, but let see what tomorrow brings. 

It feels like a little bit of bursitis on my right hip. An old problem that I'm slowly working on. 

Tonight I'll work out my schedule for (a) the Auckland marathon, and (b) completing a towering stairs (six months, each doing 10 Miles more).
