That felt rather good. I pushed it a wee bit on the last kilometre ... 

Having said that, my heartrate continued to get lower on this route. My fitness (or something) must be getting better.  

The humidity today is only 83%. It's very quiet in town. No revellers on K' Road, but perhaps I'm a bit late 

As I've been writing this a pool of sweat has collected in the deck where I'm sitting :)  So I did do some work.
