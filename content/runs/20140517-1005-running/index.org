Based on my 5 Km race results, Jack Daniels suggests that my marathon pace should be 4:26. WTF? I was thinking of sub 5:00 for a 3:30:00 time. If I go with Daniels that would be a 3:08:00 marathon. Tight now that feels like crazy talk. 

So, I set Runmeter for a 4:26-ish pace and head off on my regular 'around the block' route. And yes, based on the pace I got (4:55) and how I felt, it is indeed crazy talk. 

And yet ....

... yesterday's treadmill workout wasn't far off that goal. Methinks I'll ponder on this and do a few experiments.
