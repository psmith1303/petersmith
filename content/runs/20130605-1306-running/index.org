Ran 15k in 1:13:23 and felt as if I could keep on going. 

This now my fastest run on this route. So that gets a big smile :)

A grey day with a bit of light rain and occasional wind. But I don't think that made any difference; well it did feel like it did. 

My target pace was 4:45-4:59 (i.e., sub 5) and that worked out okay. That shouldn't be a surprise as that's my target MP.  Next week I might try and do 17k at this pace. 

Achilles feel a bit tight. Stretching here I come.
