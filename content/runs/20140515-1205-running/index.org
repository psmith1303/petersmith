Reverse direction (anti-clockwise). And then my usual direction. Then back again. 

Found some new muddy and slippy bits. Note to self: tree roots can be invisible in dappled light (but oh so picturesque). 

Fresh. Sunny. Sometimes showery. 

Really noticing how hard concrete is in these shoes. I said they were shot sometime ago, but never replaced them. Maybe it really is time. 

Nice day out. 

Forgot to stop the clock at the end of the run. So my pace will be 'off' a little.
