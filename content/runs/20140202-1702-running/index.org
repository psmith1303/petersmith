It's been a stunning weekend, weather-wise, so I left this run until a bit later in the day. Still gorgeous. 

The shops in Ponsonby were largely closed, and the bars had people spilling out onto the pavements to enjoy the evening sun. That made some of the run tricky, so I headed down to the waterfront. Nice. Busy still, but nice. 

A solid run. Nothing of note other than the most excellent weather. 

Last month I ran over 200km. I haven't done that since last March!  Of course that's not much to folk like @lisa_b, @mgcini, @tago, and others. Yet, for me it's a good sign.
