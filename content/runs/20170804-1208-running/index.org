That felt more run-ish and less like a recovery run. That signals a new phase in my running: base development. 

That'll be three easy 5km runs a week for six or eight weeks, building to five runs a week. 

There'll be some natural pace improvement , but then I'll work on building distance. That's my base-building phase. 

Not a bad run. The weather was spectacular. Bright and cool. The best of an Auckland winter.
