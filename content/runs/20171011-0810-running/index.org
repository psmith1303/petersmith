Woah. That was work. 
After 3.5 km, I kept going to 5 km before turning around and trying to catch Janine. That meant she had a 3km (15 minute) head start. 

I pushed hard, going from 7min/km to something more like 5min/km. but I couldnâ€™t catch her up 

But it made me work. 

Showers. Sun. Wind. Rainbows. Nice.
