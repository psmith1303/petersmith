My plan was to stick with Bryan as he normally does a solid 4:30 sort of pace. Today, he was well on form and was doing 4:15s for the first two kilometres. 

Off the back of a week off, 17 km yesterday, and a touch of DOMS I couldn't hang on. Then, at about 3.5 km I got a stitch:(

Do that last Km or so was a matter of pushing it out. 

Nice to see Mark. He looked on form.
