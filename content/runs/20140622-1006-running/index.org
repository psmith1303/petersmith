The playing fields at the Domain are pretty wet (and hence muddy and slippy). That made the run a bit more interesting than usual. After all, I wasn't in trail shoes :)

Ankle still grumbling, but it is way better than it was at the start of the week. I'd give it a 3/10. My achilles is good. My hip is good. I'm not complying here, just tracking progress. Actually feeling really good overall. 

Mixed weather; was sunny, now it is trying to rain. Great temperature for running.
