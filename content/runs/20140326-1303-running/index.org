A good run, as a big portion was with @andrew_e. Another stunning day in the city of sails. 

Didn' feel at all bad after yesterday's effort. But kept it easy, except when a runner passed me ... I didn't resist tucking in behind him until we had to go different ways. I'm sure it will show in the pace data.
