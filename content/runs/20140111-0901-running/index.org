I'm a bad bad boy. As I was waiting to cross the road to start my run, a runner on the other side passes me. By the time I cross the road she is about 400 or 500 meters ahead of me, and I guess she is doing something about 5:00 pace. Now, that's about my target pace ... and I'm meant to be taking it easy. 

But a rabbit is a rabbit. And I must chase those rascally wabbits. So, I slowly wound her in and eventually passed her. 

So my easy run was blown out of the water ... Most of this run was under 5:00 pace. Naughty, naughty, naughty. (But I wasn't trying too hard according to my heart rate; that's running on the flat.)

Did this listening to tunes from 1980 (not the 1980s; just one year).
