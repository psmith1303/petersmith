After a break of 25 days or so, I'm back testing out my right hamstring. 

No aches at the start. Around 1 km I felt a little tightness. By 2 km into hammy was achy. By 3 km I wasn't noticing it much although I was getting a bit of a pull on my right medial collateral ligament. 

Definite tightness in my right lower back after I stopped. 

Sounds like I'm falling apart :)

But not too bad really. I'll give it a couple of days rest and then try it again.
