Well, to misquote Eccels, "Everybody gotta be somewhere!" and this is where I am.

This is going to be something of a journey over the week, and I'm not sure how long it will take. The plan is to rebuild my website to be my take on the [[https://indieweb.org/why][IndieWeb]] incorporating [[https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/][Webmentions]].

I have tried the first part---IndieWeb---with some success already. But it is a bit of a kludge on my existing site. Hence me starting with a clean slate, and doing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

hugo new site IndieWeb

hugo new theme Papyrus

#+END_SRC


I'll then build out =Papyrus= to be fit for purpose.

The next step will be to put the infrastructure in place so that Webmentions work.

Before I 'go live' and (re)publish the site, I'll import all my old content.
