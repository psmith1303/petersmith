Run 8 of 80. Is this what a double-day is like. An hour with Kat, working out, took a bit of a toll. Still, once my schedule is normalised it will be easier as Friday's run will only be about 5 km. 

Having said that, I feel good about today's effort(s). My foot continues to prove, albeit slowly. 

One-tenth if my way through my windup fir the Auckland marathon. I'll start speed work in August (with O'Hagan's fun run). I'll start hill work next week (well, what counts for hills around here). 

A fine day. A lovely sunny run (and I hear it'll be wet tomorrow).
