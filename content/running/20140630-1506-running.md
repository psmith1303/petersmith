Doing chores (returning belt sander). Cor, it was heavy (at least 6 kg). You can see from my pace when I dropped it off. 

The rain was a bit cool when I set off, but by the end if the run it just seemed wet and pleasantly refreshing. 

At the end if the run I found myself outside Specforce Fitness, so I thought I would check it out. It's convent ... a couple of hundred meters from home. Serves coffee. And is run by a former Army PT Instructor (those guys used to be brutal). Sounds like my kind if place. The treadmills look good.  The classes are a bit crossfire-ish. But it fits with the book I'm reading on CF for endurance runners. 

I'll report more after my first free trial :)
