Ran 24k in 2:05:20 and felt good. 

The hills in the first half of this route put a big dent in my average pace so I had to work hard in the second half to get back 'on track'. In the end I averaged 5:12 and the goal was 5:09.  The first 12k in 1:04:39, and the second 12k in 1:00:41. Negative splits ... that doesn't happen very often to me. 

Caught 2 rabbits, but what really made my day was getting a mention on 'marathon talk'. It's a podcast that, of late, I've been listening to on my long runs. 

A bit wet.  A bit windy. But mostly warm and humid. 

Today's run was inspired by the folk who took part in the Tarawera Ultra at the weekend (@tago, @louise, @mark_c and their pacers @kim and @matt). Those folks are incredible.
