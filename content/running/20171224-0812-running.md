New shoes; and I can feel the fresh cushioning. But I still think my old ones have life left in them. 


It was warm, and after yesterday’s long walk my legs were a bit heavy (no it wasn’t the shoes). 

No diclofenac, and I felt my back a little on the rise and when I stopped. I’ll do some stretching ... that said, I did do some yoga to warm up before the run.
