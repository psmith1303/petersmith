Did I mention that I'm kind if tapering ahead of the Onehunga half marathon on Sunday (if I do it). 

So, a short run today at MP (not HMP) on the tready (hill mode). Oddly pleasant. Maybe it was the gentler pace, the less aggressive hills (nothing over 5 degrees), or the fact I was listening to the soundtrack to "The Rocky Horror Show". 

Did a brief bit on Jacobs Ladder before I remembered I'm tapering :)
