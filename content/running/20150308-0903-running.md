Round the Bays. How I love/hate you. 

The start continues to be shambolic. The walkers and runners are mixed. People don't follow the rules (walkers to the left). 

This year there was RFID timing, so everything was not based on gun time (as in previous years). Good job too as it took me 4 minutes of walking from the gun to me crossing the start. 

So many people skip the start and start walking early. So you are dodging walkers and prams all the way. 

The good. The weather. The sea views. And yes, the people. It's a great atmosphere. 

My goal was 40 minutes ... I am early in my training cycle. So I'm happy with my 39:30. 

No for some breakfast.
