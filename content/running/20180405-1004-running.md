Thatâ€™ll be my longest run in about 6 months. My knee feels fatigued rather than achy. Whereas my post-tib is a bit grumbly. 

As a long â€˜Runâ€™ I kept it easy on the way out and a bit more effortful on the return leg ... if my heart rate monitor is to be believed. 

Pretty hot weather-wise. All good prep for Rarotonga.
