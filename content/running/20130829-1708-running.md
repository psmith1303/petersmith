Ran 8k in 39:18 and felt good. 

First time out with the the University of Auckland Running Club. I finished in the middle of the pack ... which, considering they are all about half my age made me feel good. Actually, thinking about my pace on the hilly bits makes me feel even better. 

A hillier and longer run than I was hoping for. Started off in a torrential and somewhat chilly downpour. But, as the sun set the rain eased.  

Left knee still annoying, but running doesn't aggregate it. The magnificent DJ--my physio--says it will take a few days for the swelling to go down. 

Oh well two more runs in two days ...
