Another brick in the wall. I'm kind of doing the minimum (and most evenly balanced) runs this month. Effectively taking it easy. 

Doing my hip work is just that, work. My lower back feels fatigued; not sore, just tired. I'll give it a rest tomorrow and do no hip work :)

Quiet out. No runners. I guess they're all recovering from Friday's marathon.
