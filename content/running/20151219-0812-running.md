Rock'in around the block to "Tracks of my Years", a playlist from @Rib Fox. Ended, the run to the highly appropriate "Those were the years". Great list Rob; thanks for sharing it. 

It's quite in town right now. The quite before the shopping storm. 

A pleasant run. Was overtaken by a guy at the 3 Km mark. If you look at my trace on #Smadhrun you'll notice where I pickup the pace to catch and pass him. Not that I'm competitive--it was just downhill. 

All in all a good run. Hammy 1/10. Quad 1/10. Slowly getting better.
