Down at the Viaduct Harbour again, running in between showers. Chance favours the prepared (mind). 

But if a police presence around the event centre because of the peace demonstration. The protestors were passionate, peaceful, and vocal. 

Anyway, my run: I found myself pushing it a bit. #Runmeter kept reminding me that my heart rate was above my target of 157. But that was the mood I was in. An enjoyable run.
