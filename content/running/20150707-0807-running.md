Run 1 of 80 in my 16-week 5 runs per week marathon plan. I've not done much planning for this really, so--for now--I'm using a plan from the YMCA. It seems sensible enough. 

What's stopped me from doing my own plan is that I try and combine it with SmashRun's "towering stairs" and I just can't make the two goals fit with one another. 

Today was an easy run at constant effort; no powering up the hills. I managed to escape the rain. It was really chucking it down hard just before I went out.
