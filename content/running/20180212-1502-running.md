Gripes. That was a hot and extraordinarily muggy run. Andrew and I were really beaten up by the weather. 

I lost about 2 kg in sweat over this 11 km run. Wowser. 

The first 6.5 km were with Andrew, then I turned around to come home and he went on to meet Sally. I think he called for a medi-vac rather than complete his run as planned. 

Did I mention it was hot. At one stage we crossed the road, just to get any shade.
