Another tailwind-headwind run. Once again, today felt like yesterday's run but this time I was about 30 seconds a kilometre faster. Running is a funny old thing, isn't it Lisa. 

I think I had used up the two eggs I had for breakfast (8 hours ago). I didn't feel full of energy on the last 2 km; but I wasn't fatigued (if that makes sense). 

Definitely warmer today. The wind was warming not cooling :)
