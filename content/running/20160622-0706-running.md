Compared to my first runs in Montreal, runs now feel much easier.  I guess I'm slowly getting my fitness back.  

Keeping it easy. Some tricky junctions put a dent in my time ... that's urban running for you. 

I see storm clouds on the horizon. It's going to be a wet one. 

Swapped out my New Balance 880 for a pair of New Balance Fresh Foam. Light. Nice. It may be time to retire the old shoes (after 450 km).
