A 'long run' of 12km. 
A nice sunny start. A nice sunny middle. A nice sunny end. But the wind coming back from Kelly Tarlton's  ... strewth, fortunately it only lasted for about 500m. I felt like I was going nowhere. 

All in a pretty good (except for the dorky driver pulling out without looking my way). Achilles--left 2/10
