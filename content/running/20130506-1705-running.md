Ran 12k in 1:03 and felt good.  

I'm trying to fit in runs when I can. No real plan or schedule. 

Started off plodding along at about 5:30s but slowly drifted up to 5:10s or so. Very gentle undulating route. Went out as far as the Peldon Rose. 

Weather lovely. Sunny but only about 11 degrees C. 

Right hammy feels tight. Time for some stretching.
