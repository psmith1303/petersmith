Jolly good run with Andrew. 

After yesterday's outing, I wasn't sure if I would be running at all today. But, in actuality, I didn't feel too bad. In any case, I ran kind of naked (no tech feedback on pace etc) do this run
Really represents how I was feeling. 

I was a good run, and just what I needed.
