Pace: I am experimenting with picking my feet up (well, kicking them towards my bum as a way of getting more pace). It worked well at O'Hagan's last night; just look at the last two Kilometres. And it worked well today. It seems like less work than trying to speed up my cadence (already above 180) or trying to lengthen my stride by reaching out.
