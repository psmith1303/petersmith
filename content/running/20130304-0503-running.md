Ran 29k in 2:33:52 and felt great. 

Target pace 5:16, actual pace 5:15. Woohoo. Got some great comments from my chums on DailyMile and that drive me along. Thanks muchly. 

But, I did get served. At the turnaround at Kohi there was a runner  a few 100m ahead doing my sort of pace. Rabbit, I thought. He looked about 5 years older than me, and seemed to be dressed casually.  As I pulled up behind him I noticed "Good shoes. Good tee.  He looks fit". At that point he gentle surged ahead. I pushed it, he surged. This went on until we were doing 4:30s. Now that's way too far ahead of my target pace. So I dropped back a bit and followed him for a couple of Km. It was the funnest part of my run.  

As something of an aside, with encouragement from a few folk, I finally tried a pair of compression
