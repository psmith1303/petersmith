Run 5 of 80. Generally good. The roadworks at Western Springs put a dent in my overall time :( It's just too risky not to follow the lights etc. began to notice my right foot in the last 400m; I think it is getting better/stronger. 

Last week of my holidays. I'll have fun fitting in my runs next week :)

This run was bought to you by the letter B, as in Brill.
