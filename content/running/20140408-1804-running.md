Oh what fun. I said to @penhryn that I would go hard, and I did. Under 10 mins again, and 2 seconds--let me say that again, 2 seconds--short of my PR. 

So the last time wasn't a fluke. This month I think I will make interval month. Let's see if I can shave 20 seconds off my PR. That sounds huge: that'll be 5 Km in 19:30. 

Perhaps I should sleep on that. 

Saw a woman run ahead if me (and I couldn't catch her) who was the spitting image of @louise_s as she disappeared into the distance. 

Oh, well it's beer o'clock now (or in my case, ginger beer o'clock). And time to look at my stats.
