The details of this run are a bit out because I didn't have a solid GPS lock at the start of the run. Hence the track of the first Km or so is all over the place. 

Tried out the Saucony Glide 3 that I bought last year (from an outlet mall in LA). Nice. I like. 

My plan is to rotate my four shoes on a daily basis. There is a bit of evidence that it results in muscles being used in slightly different ways, which reduces some of the overuse injuries. 

A mellow Easter Friday.
