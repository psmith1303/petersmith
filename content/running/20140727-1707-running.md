I don't often do evening runs, but it's been a busy day. Practicing with the new 'Vella machinations ', finishing the little side table I made, putting up the new wall clock (with a silent sweep hand to time the extraction of coffee). 

Anyway, the result was a solid 'long run' as per plan. A bit of a hill, but all pretty good.
