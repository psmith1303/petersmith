Ran 7.6k in 40:26 and felt good. 

More or less the same hilly-ish route as Thursday but a bit pacier (5:17 vs 6:20). Nice. Still trying to think about my form.  Achilles a bit tired. 

Big mistake running up Mt Eden (it has a narrow road winding up). It was dark, and I had no lights. Don't know why I didn't think about that before I set out. Actually bumped into a group of people walking up the Mt, and only just missed a woman running down. 

It was nice to get back on the well-lit streets again.
