Not quite the route I had planned. It's hard to maintain a GPS lock in the narrow and deep canyons that make up many of the roads here in Venice. 

The many bridges over the canals both shape the route and and add in a new type of hill work. 

Remembering Hannah's comments about tourists, I set off earlier; but in some places--e.g., the station--it was still pretty busy. Saw three other runners and lots of street sweepers.
