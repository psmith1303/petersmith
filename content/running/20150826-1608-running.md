Run 36 of 83. Some rolling hills. 

I can feel my distance pace improving. It's heading closer 5:00 min/km. Marathon pace. Hmm. 

Lovely day for running. Light breeze. A bit of cloud cover. 

Running at this time of day is tricky because of the traffic. With a few big junctions to cross, I have to wait for the lights at times. Too dangerous to risk dodging the lights.
