Injuries: what injuries. No problems with my rolled ankle, at all. 
Hydration: good
Nutrition: pretty good--maybe I don't need the pre-start Gu 
Preparation: poor. I just didn't do enough long-long runs and it showed. 

(GPS data is a mess as I accidentally paused it; but the totals are right). 

The first 26 km felt faultless. But everything slowly unwound from there. By 32 km it was hard to walk, let alone run. My abductors and the bottom of my quads were really complaining. So, there was a lot of walking and not much running, especially in the last 5 km. Of course I ran over the finish line.

All in all, I happy and I think I understand why my result was what it was. 

Nice to see Graham Sharpe at the finishing line, and Tago and Maurice at the start. I also saw Jason B. on the course.
