Hills. The first 5k saw me going up the eponymously named Valley Road. I say "up" because the road does not run along the valley floor. Rather, for about 1km it steadily works its way up the side of the valley. Nice. 

Then the Shoe Science 5k run saw us going up Mount Eden. Nice. 

All in all, about 289m of ascent and 318 of descent. Nice.

Left Achilles grumbled a bit ... 2/10.
