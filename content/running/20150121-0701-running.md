Felt like I was running on empty this morning, and perhaps I was  

I'm trying the 5:2 diet (Christmas was unkind to my waistline) and yesterday was a fast day. That meant I had around 300 calories. Of course I had breakfast today (two fried eggs and oat bran) but that had not had time to be processed. 

So I felt tired throughout the run.
