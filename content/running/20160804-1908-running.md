Out with the Headington Road Runners again (hereafter HRR). Joined the 8:15 min/mile group ... that's about 5:07 in real money. 

Not bad; it's nice not to have to think about the route and just follow along. Quite a zigzagging route by my standard. It was nice to see a different part/parts of Oxford. 

My quads are feeling pretty tight. I need to loosen them up some how.
