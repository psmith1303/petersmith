Ran 18 km in 1:43 and felt good. 

That was a pretty wet run. Should have worn my contact lenses as I couldn't see a thing through my glasses. 

Quite a few other runners around. The all seemed particularly sociable, saying "Hi", and the like. Maybe it's a consequence of the rain. 

Running along Park Road, everything seemed closed except for on cafe proudly proclaiming "Sort of open".
