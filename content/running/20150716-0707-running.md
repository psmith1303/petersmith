Run 7 of 80. How quickly they pass. 

There is a new pizza place in town, Pizzeria Rossi Pomodor, so I picked up a menu as I ran past. Looks worth a try, so that's tomorrow's dinner taken care of. 

An uneventful run. I was going to step back and do 6 km, at at the 3 Km point I felt good and went the whole distance.
