Well that was fun. Stayed the the pack leaders (four of them). About half way two peeled off because they had reached home. A couple of hundred metres on, a third bailed with an injury. 

So, Maddy and finished the run by ourselves (well ahead of the rest of the pack). Maddy was running in her bare feet as her Five Fingers were a bit muddy. She seems like quite an accomplished runner (mainly trails, mainly long distance). 

Generally a good run. Some twinges in my right Achilles; yesterday's run at Karapiro in walking shoes ... maybe. Nothing to worry about.
