Another stunningly good day in my part if kiwi-land. Fab run. Easy except for the bit of effort required going up the hills. 

Some crazy comments as I was running changed my smile to an enormous grin. The pedestrians must have thought I was crazy (and there are few of those on K' Road). 

Most excellent. 

Ankle a little twingey; I hit a kerb wrong. Nowt serious.
