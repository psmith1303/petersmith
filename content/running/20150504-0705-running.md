Ran 21 km in 1 hour 51 minutes and good. 

Caught 2 rabbits at Westhaven Marina, and a group of 3 along the waterfront. I can see where I sped up in my splits :) I do like a bit of a chase. 

Two things on this run didn't quite work for me. First, my route had me finishing going up a hill. What was I thinking? That made the last 1/2 km something of a grind. 

Secondly, I ran in a pair of PhD smartwool socks. Alas, they don't handle my sweaty feet too well and by about 14 km I could feel them (and not in a good way). Back to polyester for me. 

Overall, I think my trading for the Huntley half-marathon is progressing nicely.
