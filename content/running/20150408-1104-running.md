Goal for this run: 19 km in zone 2 (heart rate under 157, and more like 148). 

Misjudged the turn around, so I only did 18 km. Good thing too as my legs felt thrashed (quads) and I had some groin pain from about 12 km. Mane I'm not ready for such long distances yet.  

Hmmm. Maybe time to rejig my running plan.
