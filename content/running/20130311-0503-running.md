Ran 32k in 2:54:52 and felt good. 

That really took it out of me. Ive not felt that fatigued since my last marathon. My glutes feel shot, my groin tendons are weary, knees are achy, but my achilles aren't too bad :) I'm really not used to running consecutive days. In the last 10k or so, nothing I did could get me going faster. 

Goal pace was 5:16, the reality was 5:27. 

But I class this as a darn good training run (and hey, I did do a PR yesterday).
