Well that's my last run in June. My running goals have been pretty much met. Yay!

Still overcast with a few spots of rain. But the storm still hasn't materialised yet. Friday to Sunday are forecast to be pretty wet too ... and I've quite a few kilometres to do on those days. Good job I enjoy rain running. 

This run was fine. I do feel a bit fitter; training works.
