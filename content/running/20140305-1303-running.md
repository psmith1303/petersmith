An easy run after yesterday's short but intense-ish effort. That was the plan. So why oh why did I choose to go up Parnell Rise? I'm not sure going slow up a long hill counts as taking it easy. 

Well I did manage to get some chores done whilst on this route. 

Even so, I did end up ahead of my median pace on this route == trying too hard. 

An easy run tomorrow then :)
