Run 28 of 80. Yesterday was a bit crunchy so I slid yesterday's run to today. I think the biggest feature of this run (aside from Mount Eden) was the rain; non-stop all the way. Refreshing. No chance of over heating :)

As Hanah mentioned, legs can be a bit  uncooperative first thing in the morning. That's true for me too. So, the wasn't a snappy run. 

Very enjoyable. Totally distracted by the book I was listening to (Fold). A good book on a run is always a sure means to make sure I don't push it. 

Early run  +  Good book  =  Easy run
