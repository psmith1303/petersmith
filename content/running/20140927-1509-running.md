I am so washed out. I think I've had six hours sleep in the last 48 hours, and no more than 10 in the last 72. The world is quite unstable. I will sleep well tonight.  

So nice to be home with my darling Princess. 

I don't need many more kilometres to hit my target for the month (160 km). I've an 8 km run scheduled for Monday, so I need to take care not to overshoot the goal ... that would needlessly increase the other goals in this staircase.
