I'm not a child of this millennium, but I sure enjoyed listening to the hits of the Noughties as I pounded the pavement. Without doubt, I have the music in me. 

A bit blustery in town today. But being a sunnyish day, the extra breeze was also a blessing. 

I have the impression that a few schools were closing up for the summer break. That'll mean it'll be busy in town next week. 

Overall a solid run, during which I spent a lot of time fantasising about doing a 3:15 marathon. Let's get a 3:30 one out of the way first.
