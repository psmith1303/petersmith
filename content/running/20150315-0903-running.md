I wasn't sure what I was going to do, run-wise, today. So I kinda went by feel mostly I was thinking about posture and heel kick. 

I all felt kinda good.

That's two kindas in one report. That's in fortunate. 

A little cooler and cloudier than yesterday, as noted by @louise. So I wasn't nearly as hot and sticky as then. 

And now, it's time for some yard work.
