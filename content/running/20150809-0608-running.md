Run 24 of 80. Not a slog. I only began to notice my legs in the last 4 km or so. Come to think of it, my quads are feeling pretty tight. 

I picked this route mainly because they are doing major (billion dollar) roadworks, and I wanted to see how it is going. The cycle-way along the motorway is going to be a pretty sweet running route. 

The forecast said squalls. I got squalls. And I got brilliant sunshine. That's Auckland. 

And now for some breakfast.
