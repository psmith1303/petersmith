In the words of@andrew_e, "I'll take that!"  I've done this route nearly 60 times, so to get an new PB on it feels good. 

Achilles 1/10. Hip 2/10 (after 5k). Didn't get any worse as I ran. 

Wet. The waves were just breaking over Tamaki Drive. Some pretty strong headwinds on the way out and the way back. 

So, from now on I think I can afford to keep all my runs easy; say slower than 4:50.
