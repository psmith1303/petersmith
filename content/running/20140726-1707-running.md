Striding out to the mellow musical stylings of Peter Skellern and his homage to "Astaire". Easy listening for an easy run. 

Saturday afternoons have to be some of the best times in the hyperverse. 

Running to do list:
1. Fix my gait. 
2. Stretch more. 
3. Strengthen my gluets. 
4. Core work
5. Run sensibly 

I see Runmeter (my favourite weapon) was listed in Time Magazine's top 50 apps of 2014. It was the only fitness app listed. I love my tech. 

And now for some stretching.
