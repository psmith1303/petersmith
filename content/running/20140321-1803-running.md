I was hoping that the skies would open and I would get absolutely drenched. But all I got was a light smattering of rain ... I'm probably wetter from my perspiration than from the rain. 

Busy/full day hence the relatively late run (for me). 

Pleasant run, and it would have been nicer with more rain. Do you have days like that?
