After yesterday that felt like an easy run, but I think my heart rate tells a different story. 

My goal was to stay below 158, but towards the end I drifted to just over 160. Looking at the graph, it rises more quickly than I would like. This matters as this pace is my goal marathon pace. The way my heart rate increases I'd blow up. 

Anyway this run was fun.
