Blue sky running. Nice. Not too much traffic around the top of town. Double nice. 

Taking it easy ... If you believe my pace, and ignore my heart rate :) No real aches and pains, but my right hammy was feeling fatigued toward the end. Trying to follow Graham's advice. 

Andrew's running is coming along very nicely. It would be good to find a way to fit into his schedule but I think there might be too many constraints to make that work.
