Not much sleep ... Only two hours on the (delayed) flight. Only three hours here at the hotel. My next flight is tonight, so this run was intended to wake me up and get some blood pumping.

Only meant to do 5 km. 

Tonight's flight will be fun. To keep my streak alive I'll have to do a 10 minute run 'in place' on the plane. That might annoy some folk, but I'll try and amuse the flight crew. (I've looked at all the options and running on the plane is the only solution). 

Didn't find the food truck I saw last time; hence the extra distance. 

Now I need to get in four or five hours of writing. Work, work, work.
