The gods of the traffic lights were smiling on me this run. 

Ran 8.77km in 43:47. 

The plan was an easy run (say, 5:29-ish) as many of the club did half or full marathons at the weekend. Alas, as I've been taking it easy this week (a step back week) I was full of beans. So, despite the uphill start I was a little faster than the pack. A little gap slowly turned into a bigger gap as I drifted towards my MP (just under 5:00). 

So, I'm here at the end and no-one is in sight. Is it :( or :)

Somehow I managed to pick up blisters on both my heels as I walked into school today. Thank heavens for blister plasters.
