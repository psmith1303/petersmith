Sometimes @kim's encouragement is like a thermonuclear strike. Sometimes, like today, it is a precisely guided stiletto. And I think it worked ...  it came in at the 1km mark and my pace picked up (look at the splits). @georgie's comments came in at the 4.5km and saw me home. 

In the last 200m someone tried to take me and I was surprised to find I had some gas left. 

Right ankle feels fatigued; I need some strengthening exercises. 


The official times aren't up yet, but this could be a PB. Let's see ...
