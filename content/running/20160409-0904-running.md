Not bad. An overcast day, but my run felt bright and light. Right quad was a bit achy ... but that's probably because the Osteo had given it a thorough going over on Thursday. 

This run didn't feel like a slog, so I guess things are heading in the right direction. 

A few bare-chested guys were running around the Domain. Their pace looked tidy.
