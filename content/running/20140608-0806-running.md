Went out run with @andrew. Hews stunning the Sri Chimoy half marathon.  I caught up with him at about 11 Km. 

So he had the 'pleasure' of my company for the rest of the race. Easy for me as I was fresh. Hard for him as he had already done 11 Km. 

Saw @jason_b --- he has a very bushy beard and he was running well. 

This must be my longest run this year, and it felt fine.
