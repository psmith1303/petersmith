I've had a great start to the day, and this run kept the goodness flowing. 

Brilliant weather. Fresh. Clear. Bright. 

There were loads if people in the Domain doing all kinds of 'keep fit'. Folk dragging large metal skids along the road. I there's were running crab style up a hill. Many runners were out and about. So much activity. 

An easy run on a good day. Life is good.
