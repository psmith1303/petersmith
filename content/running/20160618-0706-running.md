The forecast for today is for a high of 31Â°C, so I thought I better get out early. Summer certainly is here in Montreal. 

The plan said 10 km, but it turned into a little more as I went to the summit of Mont Royal. Loads of runners around. It certainly is a popular activity here. 

Last time I was at the Chateaux on top of the Mont was a couple of years ago with Lisa, Lisa, and Yvon.
