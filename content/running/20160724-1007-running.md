Ah the joy if British running; stinging nettles. The seem to be everywhere, and a few caught me :(

A longish run around the town: urban, road, and towpath running. I've not signed up for the Auckland marathon, but this signals me winding up towards it. If I'm actually ready in time, I'll try and pick up a ticket on TradeMe. 

A few wrong turns on the way, and the last three kilometres were irksome. But I feel good about the run.
