This was meant to be 8 Km, but I got a little lost at times :) That happens in a new city. 

Some sun, some clouds, some traffic. 

Went to a Sports Direct to look for shoes. The prices are okay, but they seem to have nothing in a 2E (wide) fitting :(

These New Balance fresh foam shoes are okay; but they aren't great. I'm after a pair of NB 880, but I've yet to find someone who sticks them. Some ASICS would be good too ... But the story is the same. Most stores seem to stick 'trainers' rather than running shoes. Time to find a specialist store.
