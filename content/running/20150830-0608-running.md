Run 39 of 83. Somewhat grey and wet. I should have worn my contact lenses rather than my glasses. 

It's strange, when I'm in my ASICS road tester gear (as I was today), I seem to be particularly jolly. Every runner I see (and most of the pedestrians) got a cheery "Good morning" and a wave. I just couldn't stop it. 

Was pretty much on track for the first 23km, then I slowed at little. But, I'm really happy about the average heart rate of 148 bpm. 

Loads of folk out doing their long runs (judging by the number with Camelbaks, munch chews, eating gels, etc).
