Being the weekend @kim_w doesn't hang around her computer, she has better things to do. But that means I miss getting her cheery comments coming at me via #runmeter  :(

Super outing. I felt the last hill on this run, but I barely noticed the hill at about 3.5 Km. All-in-all the run felt easyish. Ankle 1/10. Not bad at all. 

Saw Doug C. as I cruised down K' Road. Maybe 'cruised' is the wrong word to use in regard to K' Road. It could be taken the wrong way. Locals will know what I mean ...
