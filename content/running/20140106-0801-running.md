Clear skies, lower humidity, light breeze = good running conditions. 

Felt good. Went well. Time to retire these shoes. They've done 350k but I'm a heavier runner (80Kg-ish). So they take a pounding. I'll switch to my new pair that are sitting on the self. 

Town is much more normal. All the good coffee shops are open. Yay.
