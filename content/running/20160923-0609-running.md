I wanted to keep this long run 'easy'. So, for about the first two-thirds (the bit with some hills) I listened to an audio book. Then, to pick up the pace, I switched to my 180 bpm running mix. It always helps me to get going. 

Not a bad run. A few twinges in the hammy after Wednesday's needling by the physio. But it settled down in the 2nd half of the run.

Really happy with my hydration and nutrition on the run. A chocolate and peanut butter Gu gel every 45 mins for energy. For water I use a Camelback with about 1.2 litres of water mixed with Horley's electrolytes. Hmmm. 

At the end if the run I'm not particularly dehydrated or hungry. But tomorrow I know I'll have the munchies.
