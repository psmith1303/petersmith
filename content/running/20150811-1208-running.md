Run 25 of 80. Stopped three times. Twice (once on the way out, and again on the way back) to watch a big dolphin or a small whale playing in the harbour ... about 400m offshore. And once for water. 

Great weather for running. Brilliantly clear and bright. Some strong winds that were bitingly cold; but the kept me fresh.  

Right hip is tight in the front. Some stretching and deep massage is called for.
