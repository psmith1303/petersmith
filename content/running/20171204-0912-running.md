Planned to do something tempo-ish. My heat rate (154) shows I was on the way, but I didn’t maintain my lactate threshold (165). 

Maybe I need to get that retested. 

Warm and sunny = hot and sweaty. 

But good. Felt my knee a bit on the first few km. Did I do something yesterday to upset it; I can’t think of what.
