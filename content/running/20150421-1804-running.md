Busy, busy day at work culminating in me facilitating a technology roadmapping workshop (the last of five). It went well but I was fried by the end of it. 

Alas, I couldn't get from the workshop to O'Hagan's in time. So I did this little outing and tomorrow I have a date with a treadmill (set to fast). 

Tried out a pair of PhD smart wool socks. They feel nice on the foot, but I slide around a bit in my shoe. Hmmm. Is it me or is it the socks. 

Now time to have a shower and then relax.
