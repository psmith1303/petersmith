 I've realised it's time for a step-back or easy week. As I've some distance goals, that means less effort this week. So no O'Hagans 5 Km race this week. I wouldn't be able to stop myself racing if I went :). I've no self control

Hence this treadmill run. I set it to 'random' level 5 at 12.2 Km/hr; that's a smidgen under 5:00 min/Km. Bumped it up to 12.3 for no real reason at 3.5 Km.   Alas, this treadmill doesn't say him much I climbed, but there was some climbing. Total Calories 608. 

Next time I'll try level 6.
