Something of an impromptu run. It was such a nice early evening, light and not to hot, and I thought "Why not?"  

Then I found myself running around Mont Royal. A 10 km run was not on my agenda as I have 10 Km race on Sunday. But 10 km it was. 

All pretty pleasant.  

Glad I did it because when I stopped I could see the dark clouds heading this way. Rain is forecast for tonight and tomorrow. 

And now for a bite to eat. Sardines, I think.
