A lovely evening for a trot around some of the inner suburbs. 

Ethan (from my MGMT300 class) joined the group. The Ks went by fairly easily as we chatted. The hills were okay; mind you, Parnell Rise is a bit of a >{%**> even with company. 

Afterwards my achilles was 1/10 and my hip was definitely nagging at 2/10. 

It's just over four weeks until the Auckland marathon and I feel under prepared. But it is what it is and there is no point in having a blow-out before the event .... I can do that on the day.
