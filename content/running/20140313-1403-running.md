Lovely jubbly. 

For the past 8 weeks or so, most of my zone 2 (easy) runs have been at the lower end of my heart rate range; around 138 with Runmeter occasionally chiding me to increase my heart rate. For this run I tried to stay at the top of the range (158). 

This time I had Runmeter sometimes telling me to reduce my heart rate. What is interesting is that 8 weeks ago this would have resulted in a pace if about 5:20. Now, it gave me a sub 5:00 pace. That's a nice improvement. 

So, a nice run.
