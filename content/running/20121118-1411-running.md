Trot to the Shoe Clinic; looking for trail shoes. 

Doc says I should do some trail running to strengthen my snack led etc (and @Louise_S said she take me trail running with her). 

Tried a few pairs trying to get the width and drop right. Currently, I'm favouring a pair of Asics (doh, I've forgotten the model, but I'd recognise them on the shelve). The actually feel better than my road shoes.
