A solid run around Mont Royal. There were some noticeable headwinds along Chemin de la CÃ´te-Sainte-Catherine. I guess I benefited from them on the other side of the Mont, but I didn't feel it. 

Lots of people moving today, and the contractors are out in force clearing up all the dumped furniture etc. 

I've been reading Austin and Butler on performativity, and spent a bit of time thinking about how I enact "I don't like hills" when I'm running. There could be an auto-ethnographical paper in that.
