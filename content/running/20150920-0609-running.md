Run 54 of 83. Wet. Wow, the rain was hammering down when I set off. I could feel the drops banging on my head (through my hat). But my weather-sense said it would improve .... And it turned into a glorious morning. Mind you, my feet never dried out; too much sploshing through puddles. 

Good run. After a start (laziness, the rain, whatever) I spent the middle 13 Kilometres at about my goal marathon pace (a sub 5:00 pace). That's good. Over the remaining six weeks, I want to spend increasing amounts of time at  GMP. 

Gotta love Body Glide, but I missed one spot on my toe, so it's a little chaffed :(

Said "Good morning" to so many runners (after the rain stopped).
