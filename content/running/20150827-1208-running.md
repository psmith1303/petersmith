Run 37 of 83. The "Oh my tired legs" edition. After a tough long run on Sunday, my hard workout on Monday with Kat left me with some DOMS. Then there was Tuesday's speed-work and yesterday's mud-week long run. So my legs were pretty much shot when I set out on this run. 

Tomorrow's 'double day' (a session with Kat and then a hill run) will be fun/interesting/challenging. 

Spring sure feels like it is in the air. So it was a lovely run from that perspective.
