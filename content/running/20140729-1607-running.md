A good run. A good day. 

My class at 8:00 went well. There are some good students in that class. The 09:00 class was pretty good too. There are some switched on students there took. And, my class at 10:00? Yes, you've probably guessed that went well too. Good students == good classes, which means a good day. 

Happy, happy, happy.
