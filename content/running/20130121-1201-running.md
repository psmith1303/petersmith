Running with the spirit of @gerilyn_s and @louise_s who both had stellar races over the weekend. Gads, those two are inspirational. 

Zero zapping. Week 3 of #jantastic. Yay, yay, yay!

A few non- tribal hills on this run (slowed me down by at least 1 minute on my average pace when doing them). Last 8k were rather hot and sweaty, good job I was running with water (first time this summer). Last two km were hard, but I managed to get back to my target pace. 

So goal was an average pace of 5:26, and my actual was 5:26. Not bad, but at times I was definitely too much on the fast side (sub 5:00). Must get more disciplined ... @kim_w, I need you to shout at me.
