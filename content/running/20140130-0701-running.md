Things are back to usual around town now. That means running at this time puts me slap-bang in the middle of Auckland's "rush hour". 

The drivers are pretty aggressive in the mornings ... they pull out from side roads at crazy speeds to take advantage of any gaps in the traffic. Things like that, and the traffic lights being against me resulted in a rather tentative run. 

But it was generally good.
