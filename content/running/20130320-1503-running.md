My usual Shoe Science run. Well not really. Turns out that it is the last one of the season. They plan to resume in the spring (October, for those folk not from around here). 

That means I need to revisit my running schedule. Maybe, now is the time to return to the O'Hagans 5k run on a Tuesday. That might be hard and/or good as I would still do my long run on Monday morning ... that would mean I'd have about 35 hours (including one sleep) to recover.  Then my next serious run would be on a Friday.  Hmmm, that might work.  

I wonder what others think.
