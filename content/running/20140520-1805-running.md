Got off to a solid start. At about 1 Km I started to chase someone down and sped up to something under 3:50 ... but I felt a twinge in my right hammy and immediately slowed down at about 1.8 Km. It's pretty clear in the pace graph. 

Although I tried to keep it easy, I seem to have slowly sped up over the next kilometre. I slowed down again at about. 4 Km when I realised I was going fast again (but not because I felt anything else in my hammy). 


Overall, I'm stunned to find that I was sub-20 mins again. If I hadn't of slowed who knows how well I might have done. 

NB: Jo was off form. She came in behind me. 

Next week is the last run if the series until August. Good job too. It's getting risky running in the dark on the streets. Even with my flouro, a car had a good go at running me dow
