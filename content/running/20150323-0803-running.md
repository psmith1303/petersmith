This was actually a long run but I accidentally stopped the run when I had a toilet stop. So look at my previous run for the other 14.2 Km. 

Generally a nice run, but I had a windy tum all the way. Took it pretty easy. I wasn't going to push myself as I was using the run to get to Ascot Hospital for some planned treatment (x-Ray guided injection of steroids into the hip joint for my labral tear--but that's a different story). 

My plan had me getting here early to cool down before the treatment. And that worked well. 

Lovely day for the run. Not too hot.  But I did gulp down a litre of Powerade at the end of the run (yes, it was all I could get hold off).
