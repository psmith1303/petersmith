The first day of a new semester. So many students ...

First run with the Uni Running Club of the semester.  Many new faces ...

Fun. 

Kept up with the bright young things for the first 7Km, then I snuck ahead as I could read the traffic lights a bit better. Does that mean with age cones wisdom. I'm not so sure. 

Generally good.
