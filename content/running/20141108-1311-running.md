One more into the breach dear friends. To the thumping sounds of "Best of bootie 2013", I took to the runners superhighway of Tamaki Drive. 

And it was super. 

A stunningly good day. I think I was helped by a tailwind on the outward leg. Of course that became a headwind on the way back. 

I don't think the plate of tapas and the chocolate ice cream I had with my brother before this run helped :)

But it felt like a good run.
