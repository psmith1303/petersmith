Ran as part of the MM50 team for the University of Auckland. No 'tech' was allowed, so these details were taken from the team timer. 

I did the first 3 laps of 2.4 kilometres in 31:30. I'm pretty happy with that. 

A very wet and blustery day. Wore contact lens so I could see where I was going :)

My first outing at Mt Smart. Hopefully not my last.
