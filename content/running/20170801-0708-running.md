Around the block. It's always a gentle start to my run when I walk up to K' Road with Lisa. It means that I start in the flat rather than bein immediately confronted by a hill of some sort. 

Listened to my 180 bpm playlist. That made this a little snappier than my recent runs. I could still feel my ankle :(
