All day the weather has been spectacular...then, around 16:00, it clouded over. So, this was a pretty wet run. 

Did the first 5 Kms with Andrew, before going our separate ways.

During the second half of the run I realised my wife and I have been together for 30 years. Despite the yucky weather I had a big smile on my face and love in my heart. 

All very good.
