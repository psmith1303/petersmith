Back at O’Hagan’s. It’s the first of the year, and the first after a long break for me. 

Pretty happy with my time. 

I thought I went out easy-ish (well easy for O’Hagan’s) so I was surprised when I looked at the 1 km mark and saw I was doing 4:34 minutes/km. I slowed a bit in the middle and then pulled it. 

Yeah, pretty happy.
