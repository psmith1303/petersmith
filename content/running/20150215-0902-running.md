Fuelled by a homemade breakfast (a chile chocolate cupcake) I pounded around the 'hood. 

Felt a bit heavy on my feet. I could hear them over Kermode (Five Live's flagship film programme ((#wittertainment)).  Still, I'm happy with my pace on this sweaty day. 

Looking forward to my 'long' run tomorrow.
