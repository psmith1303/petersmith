Run 41 of 83. My legs didn't feel fatigued, but there wasn't much vavoom in them. The headwinds in the return leg didn't help. 

Actually, I was doing okay for the first 6 km (30 minutes). Isn't that about when the first "fuel system" switches over?  Anyway, that's when my spring wound down. 

Now to plan my mid-week long run for tomorrow. I think a 13-miler is called for.
