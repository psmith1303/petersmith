At Oxsrad with the Headingyon runners. Finger trouble meant that I didn't record the details of this interval session. Grrr. 

It was work. I've only just got over the slight DOMS from Sunday's long run. That combined with a large lunch and some tightness in my hamstring, meant that I took the second half of the session a little easier. But I was still sweating hard.
