Run 76 of 83. Testing the waters. And the water is calm.  

The physio (Will), pummelled my hammy and strapped it immediate prior to this run. So I felt the pummelling and the tape, but the run seemed fine. 

My plan then is to keep the leg mobile. Do a few light runs and one 10 km to see if I feel up to a marathon on Sunday.
