Ran 32k in 2:57:44 and felt blah. 

Target pace was 5:06, and the reality was 5:33. 

My mental game didn't desert me, it didn't even turn up to the start line. 

My back is still tender and that put my gait out. So my knees ache, my ankles aches, but my achilles seem okay :)

But I did it any way. Now to get showered and down to work.
