It's hot in the city, hot in the city tonight. 

The first leg--my warm up for the Shoe Science weekly run--was a moderate 5:51 pace. But it felt harder than that. I guess it was the heat

The second leg, the actual Shoe Science 5k run--was a hoot. A young lad and I (Arun?) were out in front all the way until I waved him on. Given the heat, I was pretty happy with my 5:10 pace. 

I put in a request for hills next week. I don't like them, but I know they are good for me. 

And then there is the easy-ish trot home. 

All in all, a nice outing. 

Looking forwards to next week run, as I have a 1 in 6 chance of winning a new pair of Saucony shoes. That would be nice.
