Ambling around Raleigh. The previous day's indulgences were weighing heavily on me. Still, no hamstring complaints. 

No real plan to this run other than to work my legs. Done!

Pretty quiet in this bit of town (around NC State University). Lots (lots) of student accommodation. A really nice park with its own railway. Quiet a few runners about, but most folk seem to be tucked in bed.
