Last weeks trip to Sydney kind of messed up my running week. So I've only just got around to doing my long run. 

Considering Tamaki Drive is something of a Mecca for runners around here, there weren't any rabbits or whippets. 

A glorious day and the beach at Misson Bay was busy. Bumped into Thomas Bohn√©, his wife and their daughter enjoying the sun. I did talk much ... had miles to do :)

Overall a lovely day, and a great thing to do whilst my darling wife gets her hair cut.
