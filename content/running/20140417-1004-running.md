I LOVE running in Auckland. It was wet and windy (stormy even) and sunny!

Tamaki Drive was closed to traffic because of the weather. But ... YEEESSS ... it was open to runners (me). 

At times the rain really stung my face, but unlike David (who is a master of running in bad weather) I had the slight advantage that the rain was warm. 

Right knee is a little sore because of the sideways wind pressure.
