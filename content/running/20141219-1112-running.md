What a stunningly good day here in The City of Sails (or is it The Harbour City; I can never remember). That went .... Okay. Some aches but they generally faffed during the run.

I was surprised how hard the teeny-weeny hill was. I was glad to stop at the traffic lights at the end of it.  

Overall, a solid start to running again.
