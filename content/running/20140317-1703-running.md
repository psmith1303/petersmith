Got lost a separated from the pack. Or was it the other way around?

The flat was nice. The hills were ... hills. 

From a training perspective I'm not sure why I run with this group. Too often the pace is such that I don't get into zone 2 with my heart rate. That seems to indicate junk miles. 

Perhaps that type of reason is why other better runners drop out.

I'll talk with M and see if there is some other way forward; split the group between beginners and more experienced runners?  I don't know.
