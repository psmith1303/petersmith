Will run for coffee. 
Ran for coffee 

A loop past Ponsonby Central, and EightThirty Coffee to get some beans. The queue was too long and I was too sweaty to wait for a macchiato... so made do with the beans. 

Quiet out. Not many runners. Passed on guy in Grey Lynne. He caught up with me in Westmere, and I tagged along with him until Coxs Bay, when we went our different ways. 

A good run.
