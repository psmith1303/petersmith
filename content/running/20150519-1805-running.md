I'll take that: a 30 second improvement over last week. Spent the first 3 km chasing down  a couple of runners in front of me, and the last 2 km trying to stay with Matt (he must have been about 5 seconds faster than me). 

Almost did negative splits all the way. 

Let's hope I have something left for Sunday's half-marathon.
