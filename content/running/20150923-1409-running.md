Run 56 of 83. Now, if only I could keep this pace for another 21 km :)

Despite some strong headwinds, I did this at my goal marathon pace. Yay. That includes stopping for water every 5 km or so. Plus a little stretch at 16 km. So definitely "Yay". 

I wonder what pace I'll manage on my long long-run on Sunday (32 km). Progress is certainly being made. 

Light rain kept me fresh. That was nice.
