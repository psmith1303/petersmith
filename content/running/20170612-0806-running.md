Another rehab run. Seems okay. 

I was quite surprise that my pace had picked up in the first kilometre to 5:30-ish. I then thought about getting more of a heel kick and that moved me up to about 5:00 pace. 

Felt a little something in my heel (inside back) at the start of the run, but it soon dropped 'off the radar'. Now, post run, I don't notice it. 

That said, I did notice my quads :) Out of practice, I guess. 

Back to the Physio on Friday for re-taping, and hopefully a 20 minute run.
