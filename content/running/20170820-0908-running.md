C'est bon dans la Cite du Sails. 

Spent a lot of this run thinking about Tuesday and the new season of O'Hagan's 5 km fun run. It'll be a step up in pace and distance from where I am now. Looking forwards to it. 

This was a pleasant run. Some sun. Some wind. Something like the start of Spring. All feels good ... but there is a faint tightness in my right hamstring. Hmmm
