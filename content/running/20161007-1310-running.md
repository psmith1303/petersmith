Ran along a bit of the redeveloped cycle track that follows the motorway. Pleasant, albeit a bit noisy. 

Spent most of the run concentrating on getting my heel up towards my ass. That increases my glide time, and thence my pace. It also works/builds my hamstrings and my gluets. 

Caught a dry spell in an otherwise rather wet day.
