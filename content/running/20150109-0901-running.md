A nice day for an amble about town. Actually, I was exploring Mt Eden, and I reckon that it's a suburb rather than part of town. After all, I live in town :)

(Nod to Tracey T.)

A little overcast so I wasn't blinded by the sun. 

Lots of dead-ends on this 'xplor. And I found a park I never knew existed. 

All in all, a fun run.
