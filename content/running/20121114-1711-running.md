A run in three parts. First a bit of a 4k warm up. Second, the "Shoe Science" 5k. Finally, a short trot home. 

The run with the folk from Shoe Science was hard. They/we went up Mt Eden. That's the first hill run I've done in 5 months (and I felt it). The seem like a good bunch and I'm likely to go back. 

Overcast, but warm
