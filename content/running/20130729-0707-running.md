Ran 24k in under 2 hours and felt great. Woohoo. 

I reckon I could have pushed this pace out to 32k. But that wasn't the plan. What was the plan was 24k at just under a 5:00 pace. 

If I miscalculated anything it was the turnaround point. I finished my run a little bit short of my destination. But that does give me room for a recovery jog :)

I was surprised to see they've pulled down the bowling green at Jevois Road.  They are building something called Vert Appartments. I guess the pun is intentional.
