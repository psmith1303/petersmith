Damp. Very damp, even though it is only very light rain. The problem is that when its this damp, sweat doesn't really work. As a consequence it runs into my eyes and they are stinging a lot of the time :(

TMI?

I haven't done this route in a long time. 
Since June. It used to be a favourite but this year I've only done it twice (not including today). Ah well, it has been a step back year. 

Fun.
