Ah, Monday. My 'long' run day. 

Being close to rush hour (ha) I tried to avoid having to cross too many junctions. Nevertheless, those I did resulted in slow crossings. 

Slowly and surely my distance is building (as per my plan). 

Ended up going past the zoo where there is a pretty steep downhill. So steep that I took it very cautiously (slowly). 

All in all, a successful outing.
