That felt like s long run! Oh it was for me. At 7 km my legs felt tired and I was convinced I was running up a long,  albeit gentle, hill. 

I'm not sure I notice the real hill in the middle of the run. 

The last 3 km were along the river towpath, and that made a very pleasant change to the uninteresting by-pass path that made up much of the run. I also had the chance to run down a rabbit; who in the last 400m of my run. 

20 minutes later, as I have my second breakfast, I'm feeling good about the run.
