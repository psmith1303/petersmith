Ran "La foulÃ©e des parcs", 10 km around the parcs/squares of Outremont. Pretty. 

Mainly flat with a small hill (twice, as the course is two laps). Cool, but the forecast rain never materialised. 

Some of the runners were very warmly dressed--not yours truly--as I guess they know about the cold here. Very few people dressed colourfully. Mind you it did seem odd to me to see crowds of runners going past Orthodox Jews in their traditional garb , including big fur hats.
