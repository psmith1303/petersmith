Ran 11k in a few seconds under 55 mins and felt good. 

I thought the last set of traffic lights was going to put paid to my goal of a sub 5:00 pace over this run. But some  luck and extra effort in the last 400m saved the day. 

Me? Data drive?  Just a bit :)

Caught one rabbit; most folk were running in the opposite direction. Thought I might see @louise_s but of course she's in Oz. I hope see has a stunning race at the weekend ... given how hard she's been training it bodes well. 

Grey day. Both the weather and my schedule for most of it. But hey-ho it's Friday :)
