This run was mainly along the canal towpath of the Isis (the headwaters of the River Thames). The further out of town I went, the more the path turned into running across fields. 

I was thinking about doing a long run (22 Km) along an extended version of this route. But running across fields is too hard work; uneven ground, cow shit, etc. So, I think I'll find another option for Sunday. 

Crossed give canal bridges (twice). Damp, but not wet really.
