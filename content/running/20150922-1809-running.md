Run 55b of 83. The Physio gave my right hammy a good seeing to yesterday, I have some old scar tissue there. So, it was feeling a bit ouchy. That's my reason/excuse for being about 25 seconds slower than last week. Either that or I went out too fast :)

Never managed to keep my rabbit in my sights.
