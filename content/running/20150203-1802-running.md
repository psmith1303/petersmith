Maybe this was not a return to form, but it is a return to getting form. 

Hot. Humid. And an occasional headwind. 

My basic plan was to go out strong and try to hang on. 4:28, 4:22, 4:39, 4:45, and then 5:05. No chance of negative splits :) 

Dread to think what my heart rate was ...  

I think I'll be back for more pain next week.
