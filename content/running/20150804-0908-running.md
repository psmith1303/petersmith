Run 20 of 80. Wow, a quarter of my way through this round of marathon training. I can't believe how quickly time is passing by. 

A pleasant enough run along the waterfront. There were a few cormorants standing on the rocks giving me odd looks. I guess runners must look pretty odd to them.  

Soon I must get into some speed training.
