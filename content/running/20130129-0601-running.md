I always enjoy the rolling hills on this route (although @lisa_b and @nic_a might not count them as hills). The hard part of this route is the last 5k or so as I go through town ... there are so many traffic lights, I find it hard to keep in my running grove. 

I was well on track to meet my target pace of 5:28, but those last Ks made a big dent in that. I guess that's the problem with doing long runs on a weekday, instead of Sunday; more traffic.  Maybe I should change the end of this route. 

I feel that my marathon training is really underway now. Rotorua here I come. 

Left Achilles felt tired but not sore.
