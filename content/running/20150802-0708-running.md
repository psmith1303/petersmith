Run 19 of 80. Taking it easy, listen to the sci-fi book "14". Loads of runners out (presumably doing their long runs too). 

Occasion misting of rain.  Occasional rainbows. Across the harbour at Devonport naval base, they were firing their large guns (practice? Salute?). 

Legs feel tired but not worn out. Ended the run on a wee hill. 

Thanks Daniela and Lisa for getting my run off to a good start.
