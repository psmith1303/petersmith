It is pretty quiet around town. Many folk have already left for the holidays, and more will leave after Christmas Day. I noticed yesterday that some cafes have already closed until mid- late-January. Nevertheless there are a lot of distracted drivers out there, so I had to be extra careful crossing the roads. That, perhaps, slowed me down  more than the heat :)

Yes, it's hot again. It feels hotter than my last run. In true Auckland style it was cloudy this morning, but that didn't stop the sun this afternoon. 

A few grumbles from my hammys. I did roller them but perhaps I need to do more.
