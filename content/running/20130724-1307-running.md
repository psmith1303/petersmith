Ran 3+3+3 in 48:16 and felt like I had worked

3k @.5:30ish as a warm up
3k @ 4:30 as pretty hard work
3k @ 5:30 as a really easy cool down

I can't believe I've been contemplating a 4:30 pace half-marathon. That's just crazy talk. I better recalibrate my goals. Mind you it is 10 weeks or so away .... ah, dream on. 

Tomorrow I think I will do mostly hills :) yummmmm
