Another gorgeous day in paradise. An easy 5 Km around the block, albeit rather sweaty ... I did say it was gorgeous, didn't I. 

The traffic light gods were not with me today. Lots of pauses. 

I'm pretty frustrated with my hammy. I notice it immediately on starting my run. Whilst it eases back during the run it never gets to zero. Today, I'll give it a 2/10.
