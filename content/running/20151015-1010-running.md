Run 72 of 83. Two by two run. My fuel for this run consisted of two hours of teaching and two flat white coffees (small). After yesterday's hard run it was hard to get my pace to 5:00 min/Km. 

Still, it keeps taper psychosis at bay. 

Another fine day in the city of sails. Spring is definitely here and I'm getting thirstier on my runs. From now on, anything over 11 km should see me taking water along.
