Gently working my legs (in general) and my right hamstring (in particular). (Re)building my base. 

Concentrating on kicking my butt. That always makes my pace faster. 

A car drove past me ... the stink of fish coming from it was incredible (and not in a good way). That sped me up a bit as I tried to escape the stench. 

Grey and damp. But I didn't get rained upon. Or if I did, I didn't notice it.
