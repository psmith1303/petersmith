Ran to the Pacific coast, and thence to Manhattan Beach (and back). Saw the sun rise ... well not really, it was cloudy here in LA. 

Some GPS problems that were only solved by rebooting the iPhone at about 17 km. 

Felt like a long run by the end. Right hammy was feeling it. Possible blister on my right forefoot (go figure).
