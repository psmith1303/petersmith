That was a hard one. I don't think I had fully recovered from the two hard workouts u did this week--intervals and a tempo run. So I went bout on slightly fatigued legs. 

Boy did I feel it in the last 6 Km. and I bet I'm going to feel it tomorrow too.

The walk home, 1 km down Headington hill pushed my already smashed quads. 

Now that I'm running more than half-marry distances, I'm going out fully loaded with water and gels.  I'm trying the Apotonia 500 gels; they're formula seems okay, except they are a little sweet. I had one every 40-45 minutes. 

Now for my second breakfast.
