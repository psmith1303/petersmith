Run 60 of 83. Woohoo. Lovely day. Lovely run. Based in Graham's comments I pushed it hard on the last Kilometre. Felt good. 

In these last five weeks of training,  my goal is to see how much time I can spend at my goal marathon pace (and faster). I can do the distance; now it's about speed. 

No O'Hagan's today as we have a graduation ceremony. So, I've moved a medium run (12 km) to today, and tomorrow I'll try and get some speed work in (5 km at a 4:15 pace or better).
