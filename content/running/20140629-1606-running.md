Well that concludes a good week in running. Overall, my ankle is stable and probably improving. The weather has been a good mix of sun, wind, and rain---ending up today with beautiful winter evening. 

Spent most of today making a piece of furniture, so this run was good to clear the wood dust out of everywhere. Note to self: must get/borrow/hire a belt sander. 

The plan for today's run (yes, Coach Kim, there was one) was  Z2 run. Slowly but surely my Z2 runs are getting faster. Most of today's splits were well under a 5:00 pace. What I want to get to is doing about 4:30 whilst in Z2. I'm getting there. 

Now for some late afternoon tea.
