Well that was fun. There were some new (aka pacier) runners. That made it more fun. The traffic lights were against us a lot of the time so it was a fragmented run; especially for the first third. 

Found myself running with a small group: a swede, someone from Exeter, and someone from the med school. Nice company.  Maybe some might come to O'Hagans tomorrow. 


Felt pretty good, but as I write this my quads feel it. That could be the leg raises I did before the run. 

A good run, all in all.
