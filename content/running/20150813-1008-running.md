Run 27 of 80. It's my mid-week long run. As I've never done weeks with two long runs in them I'm keeping the pace easy. In addition, I'm now getting into the territory where easy week is my biggest week volume/distance wise. 

Once these mid-week long runs top out (at 20km), I'll work on their pace. 

Lovely day for a run around town. Listening to "The Fold", by the same guy who wrote "14". I must have liked the last book :)
