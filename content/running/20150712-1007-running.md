Run 4 of 80. Should have be a long (21Km) but I'm being gentle with my foot (and that seems to be working). 

Stunningly good weather. Brilliant sunshine. Big blue sky. And fresh. Great running conditions. 

I feel this plan may well work (now there is an interesting sentence construction, and quite different to "may work well").
