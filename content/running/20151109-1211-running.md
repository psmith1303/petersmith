My first run since the #AucklandMarathon. I suppose this is also the start to my wind-up for the #KirikiriroaMarathon in March (Hamilton, in case you are wondering). 

This felt a bit too much like work. Right hamstring was good. My quads were feeling a bit achey (still), especially going down the hill on East Street. 

Feet were feeling good in my #ASICSnz Gel Nimbus. I hope I can make them last until the next marathon ... but I kind of doubt it. With 20 weeks or so until Kirikiriroa, at an average 60 kilometres per week that's over 1200 Km.  Even with some shoe rotation I'll get through three pairs of shoes. Oh, well that's a god reason to try out the @ASICSnz Gel Hyper Speed (if I can find them). 

I spent sometime at the weekend roughing out my trading plan; more to be done yet.
