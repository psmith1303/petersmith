There was definitely weather on this run. Continuous rain and some pretty impressive wind. The wind was so strong I couldn't listen to my audiobook, so I switched to music. The wind also made the rain sting when it hit me full force. 

Geese: my loops round the Domain resulted in me crossing paths with a gaggle of geese. It was quite clear that they were disinterested in me, and so I had to wind my way through them. Each time it brought a smile to my face. 

Thanks to Mark, Daniela, and Lisa. Your comments spurred me on at the end. 

Felt pretty good after this run. Managed to catch a couple of rabbits in the last 3 km. They seemed a bit surprised to see me stride past. 

Alas, I lost battery power at the 20 km mark. I only had 30% charge when I set out, so I knew it would be close ,,, hen
