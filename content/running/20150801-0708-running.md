Run 18 of 80. Taking easy around town. Felt kinda sluggish today. Heart barely went over 140 bpm, and my pace was pretty relaxed (5:50). 

Not really a make up run for skipping yesterday (which should have been the same distance, but hills). But tomorrow is a longer run and I wanted to be fresh for it.  

Having said that, I am a little tight in my back. Ekaterina worked me good yesterday and there is some recovery still to be done.
