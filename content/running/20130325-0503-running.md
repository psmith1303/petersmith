Ran 32k in 2:46:36 and felt great.

At times I noticed my left achilles (1-2 out of 10) but changing my gait eased it. When I stopped at the end and started walking I noticed an ache in my left instep, and that my lace was undone. 

All good I think. 

My goal pace was 5:16 and I actually did 5:12. 

But the high point was at 28k where @andrew_e videoed my gait, and then ran with me. It's been a while since we've run together. Marvellous to run and talk with him. I'm looking forward to doing more of that as he recovers. 

Practice my nutrition on this run. Camelback loaded with water/Horley's Replace. A Horley's chocolate and caffine gel at 15k, and one of their plain chocolate gels at 30k. That seems okay. I don't feel particularly hungry or thirsty at the end of the run. 

Caught eight r
