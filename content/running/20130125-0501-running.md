Arduous. It's been a long while since I last did sprints and my body knows it. BUT it was so fun. 

Okay, here was the drill:
Warm up 2k-ish
6 x 800m with 2 minute recovery interval
Warm down. 

The first sprint (800m) was at about 4:10, the last was 4:50. Hard. 

Lots of runners in the Domain. Fortunately, I was going anti-clockwise around the Domain, so I did  not end up racing/chasing anyone. Was chased by a toy poodle. 

Job done.
