Out at the Boxing Day #ParkRun. Warm. 

Hammy 2/10. 

Some of the route is on rather gravelly trail. That means less traction and more work. There is also a bit of a hill. As a consequence, this will never be a fast run for me ... but it was moderately hard (HR in the 170s). 

Saw Jason Buckley (doing his thing; 10 ParkRuns before lunch). Also saw John Paynter and a few other University of Auckland runners). 

Now off home to cook BBQ brunch.
