Another day in paradise. 

A tidy run. 

Changing my gait to a longer slower stride is interesting. I can feel my feet getting tired; they aren't used to this type of work. There is a longer roll-through, and this is working the tendons in my foot. At least, that's how I think about it. 

All pretty good.
