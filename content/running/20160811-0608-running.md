Fitted this run in early as I'm off to the Cotswolds to meet some long lost relatives. 

It's been raining overnight so it was a cool start but I soon warmed up. Mind you, I was keeping it easy. The stretching I did after Tuesday's hard session had worked well; my quads weren't too bad at all. 

Spent sometime working on my 'heel kick'. This tired by right hammy; it's still a bit weak. 

All in all a good run.
