A short run before today's session at the APROS conference. 

Finally, I managed to run across the Sydney Harbour Bridge--last time I ended up on the bike-lane and was turned back by security staff when I was halfway across .  

Warm, and well on the way to the high of 33 degrees that is promised for later. Sweaty!!

Lots of commuters (walkers and runners) on the bridge, together with a few runners (runners without backpacks). 

Hammy is feeling a wee bit better, but my right quad is still feeling a bit abused. But things are heading in the right direction.
