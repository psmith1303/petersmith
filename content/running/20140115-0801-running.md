An easy run around the waterfront. Really nice. 

There were quite a few runners around (more than usual). A lot of them seem to be built more like @jason_b or @lisa_s (lean) rather than like me (20-25% body fat ).  Maybe it has something to do with the Auckland 70.3 tri at the weekend. 

Oddly inspiring.
