Ran 1 mile in 11:02 and felt good. 

Hammies were a bit blah (DOMS?) after yesterday's fun run. They were a bit tight yesterday, and the heel kicks, strides, skipping, etc might have been a bit OTT. 

Tried to concentrate on my style, especially wrt being light on my feet and my heel strike. 

So many acronyms today.
