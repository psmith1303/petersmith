Ran 24k in 2:02:03 and felt excellent. 

Target pace was 5:06, and my actual pace was 5:05. Super. The goal is to hit the goal ... not to beat it. 

My first long hilly-ish run. I've left my hill training late, but I wanted to have my achilles under control (0/10 today). Given Rotorua is a hilly course, my lack of hill training is a wee bit concerning. However, I've done a total of 280m of ascent on this run, so I'm heading in the right direction. Over the remaining five weeks I try and build up the hill work (without overcooking it).  

A little light rain at the start, but it brightened up nicely. Should have had my sunnies with me. 

As I take the free bus home, I see the signs are out for the 'magic mile' race today. One mile, downhill on Queen Street. Big shout out to @jason_b who is
