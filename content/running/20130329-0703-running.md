Ran 11k in 56 minutes and felt good. 

Way better pace than my median on this route. Some tightness in my right hammy and so slowed down over the last few Km. 

Got overtaken by a whippet on one of the early hills. But, that did inspire me to pick up the pace (chase). That set the tempo for much of the run. 

A bit of indigestion ... Hot cross buns for breakfast were so good.
