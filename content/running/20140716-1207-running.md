F@&( me. 

To the thumping beats of "Lashed" by Lisa Lashes I did hill sprints. Three of them. And now I'll die. 

My heart rate was a bit wonky on the first repeat and topped out at 214. And I believe that. Each trpeat was about 250 m long. Every time I found myself flagging at about 200m. 

Fortunately, my loop had traffic lights so I could catch my breath. 

Fun. Maybe. But I'll be back, and next time I'll try for four repeats.
