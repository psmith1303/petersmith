Only four plus me on the run this week. Took it pretty steady. 

But somehow I found myself out in front, and eventually by myself. 

Up by the hospital, a whippet came past. I just locked in his pace, and rode on his shoulder all the way back to the gym. 

Few aches. Achilles 2/10 :( I thought I'd seen the last of the twos. Some hip twinges. Grrr.
