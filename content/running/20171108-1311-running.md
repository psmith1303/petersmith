My long slow distance run for the week. Not so slow. Not so distance. Went out a bit fast and never really settled into my 5:30 target pace. 

I think listening to my audio book helped to keep my pace down (but not enough). 

Still, overall it felt like a good run. 

A nice day now that the rain has passed.
