Ran 11k in 52:34 and felt crazy good. 

Looking at my average heart rate, I was working on this run. And indeed it felt that way too. A new PB On this route.  I think my fitness is coming together for the Rotorua marathon. If only I can get my MP locked in. 

A sunny day, so I felt warm :)

Caught one rabbit, and got away from one whippet.
