Four rabbits, and was passed by two herds of reindeer (or were they packs of cyclists wearing antlers). Crossed paths with @louise_s twice; she was gliding along on her bike, it looked effortless ... No wonder she had a big smile. 

So that's my zero zapped for the week and my long run out of the way. 

It's much cooler running this earlier but the humidity does take its toll. 

Overall, a jolly nice run; the longest one in five months.  I feel back on track.
