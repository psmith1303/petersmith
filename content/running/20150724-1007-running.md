Run 13 of 80. A good workout with Kat, followed by a delightful bacon buttie, was the warm for this romp up Mt Eden. 

I was hoping to have Andrew as company but he is out of town today ... however, next Friday he assures me he'll be up for it. 

I tried to keep this run easy-ish as I'm still building up my miles after my layoff from that calf tear. I think that goal was met :)

It kept threatening to rain, and from the top of Mt Eden I could see light rain sweeping through parts of the city. But I managed to escape the wet. 

My next real run will be Sunday. 22 Km.  I wonder how that'll go.
