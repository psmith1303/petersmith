Well, well, well. I started of shoulder to shoulder with Jo (the tri woman) and I stayed there or slightly in front of her until just before the 4 Km mark when she slid in front of me and stayed about 20 m ahead all the way to the end. 

I thought I'd been pretty consistent at about 4:00 all the way round; not putting the peddle to the metal, but working. 

So imagine my surprise at a new PB, and by 14 seconds. Yeeha.
