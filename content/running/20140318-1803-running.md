I think this is a new PB @ 20:13. Yay!  

Okay that's only 1s per kilometre faster the last one, but it counts (and it feels like it was hard work). 

I now know the secret of beating @jason.  Make sure he has run 50k or so first. (Even then it's work)

&tago was here too. Is there no stopping the ultra marathoner guys?

And now for the free drink ...
