Ran 19k in  1:35:27 and felt stuck. 

Ground this one out. I never really managed to get much under 5:00min/k :)

Even when I thought I was pushing it, I was still within cooee of 5:00. Back felt tight so I was trying to keep good form ... I'd hate to think that good form  was slower form. Nah. Must be something else. 

Bit breezy, but not enough to keep my face dry. 

Had some problems with the HR monitor. At one stage it seemed to be double counting. Was rather happy when, at about 10k, it said my HR was 145 (and my pace, you guessed it, was 5:00). 

Considering 5:00 is my goal MP, all in all, a little disappointing.
