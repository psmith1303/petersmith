@Andrew_e tried to gently talk me into doing a 11 Km run. But I was good and stuck to my plan. 

And what a day it was for a run! Super. Super. Super. And Andrew for company too. The miles just flew by. 

An easy workout, but Andrew might have other views. Interestingly his VO2max is about the same as mine ( 52).
