That went okay. Hammy still a 2/10 ... most notably at the start of the run. Grrr. 

With only 11 weeks or so until the Hamilton marathon, I need to get a plan together. 

The weather forecasters have been predicting rain for a few days and finally it came. So this was a wet run. 

Feeling fitter :)
