Striding out to the musical styling so if "Heaven 17". 

Bournemouth is pretty flat really (unless you go down the cliffs to the beach). Today I ran around the 'suburbs' of Bournemouth (Winton, Talbot, Boscombe, etc). Nice to see more places of my childhood,such as Talbot Woods and Slade Farm. 

Got a little turned around at the end; so I didn't see as much of Boscombe as I had hoped. 

A very enjoyable memory jogging run.
