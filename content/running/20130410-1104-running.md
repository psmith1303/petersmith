Ran 7.6k in 39:42 and felt pretty darn reasonable. 

Oh happy hills. If I can build on this hill pace for Rotorua I'll have a fighting chance of doing under 3:30:00. 

I did stop the clock on this run for a couple of minutes ... most unlike me. I popped in to the "House of Knives" to checkout some Merkur razors. 

Back to the run. Pleasantly sunny, but I didn't fell hot. The heart rate monitor wasn't on right at the start, so the numbers are a bit wonky. 

It was hard work going up Mt Eden. A lot of puffing was involved, but felt good as I did it. This may become a regular run until Rotorua. 

Friday: I think intervals might be in order. But let's see what the physio says tomorrow.
