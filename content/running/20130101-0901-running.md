Inspired by folk like @Maurice_T and spurred (nagged) on my others like @Lisa_B I ran a mile today. And tomorrow I'll do at least another. And we will see how it plays out. 

Nice weather. But as I sit here writing I can feel the sweat running down my neck (after just a mile). 

My legs feel so weak. Why's that? They should be happy that I lost over 4Kg in the last week. Maybe they are just out of practice. 

Achilles good. 

A month ago (or maybe more), @Andrew_E commented that I sounded heavy on my feet. Today, I really noticed that too. I wonder what is going on there. The wear patterns on my shoes seem to suggest a mid-foot strike ... well there is wear in the midsole (more than, say, on the heel). These shoes haven't done over 400km. Hmm.
