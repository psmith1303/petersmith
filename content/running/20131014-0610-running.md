Hmmm. That was interesting. Hip/ groin begs to play up around the 10k mark and then settled down again around the 15k mark. I've no idea what that means for the Auckland marathon in just under three weeks. 

Ah well, I think I'll keep all my runs under 15k 'till then. Not a great plan but it might work.
