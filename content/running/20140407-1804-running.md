A bit of a run with @andrew_e until we had to go our separate ways. A great evening for it, and matched by the great company. 

On the outward leg I struggled to keep my heart rate up. On the way back I stretched out my legs so it was less of a problem. 

Some really busy roads. That made some of the crossings difficult/slow. That put a dent in things as I don't pause (auto or otherwise) on those occasions. 

Next Monday I think I'm back with the Uni Runners.
