Ran 16 km in 84 minutes and felt good. 

Better than my median time on this route. 

Autumn weather in Auckland. Sunshine, rain, wind, WIND, sun, rain and wind. The headwinds in the way back were impressive. But the run felt fairly good. 

The physio had been working on my ankle in the morning and it felt a little fatigued, but not bad. 

All in all, a nice outing.
