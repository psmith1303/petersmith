Hoofing it around the 'hood.  Hearing hits from heady '93. 

Medium effort as I am doing a 3 km leg in a cross country race tomorrow. Although I'll be the youngest in our masters team, I may well be the slowest. But, tomorrow is another day. 

Super weather. A bit busy in town: probably because it is a long weekend.
