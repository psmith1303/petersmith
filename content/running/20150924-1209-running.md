Run 57 of 83. Some kind of hills. I've never done this route without Andrew, and it reminded me what excellent company he is. 

This route includes a short sprint towards the end. That's hard. I suspect that when I look at the data that I'll see I was a bit of a slug. 

Note to self: must get a new battery for my heart rate monitor. 

The view from Mt Eden was pretty stunning.
