Oops. I was checking my nascent running plan when I realised that most of my runs this week should have been 4 km, rather than 3 km. So today's run was a little longer than I originally thought. 

Gently glode (yes, that is the word I wanted as 'glided' does not flow easily) around town. Unexpectedly, crossed paths with Chris Williams who was out for a run too. We chatted for about a kilometre then our paths diverged. 

Despite last nights rain, it's still pretty hot and sticky. It was a great delight to be met at my front door by my wife who gave me an icy fruit smoothie.
