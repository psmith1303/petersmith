There is a scene in Crocodile Dundee where someone attempts to use a knife mug our hero. Mick Dundee responds by saying "That's not a knife; this is a knife". Every time I do a bit of a hill in my mind I hear Lisa or Nic saying "That's not a hill; this is a hill". 

Some more running on the grass. A little pacier than usual--ahead if my median pace. Nice. 

No real signs of the tropical cyclone that's meant to hitting us in the 12 hours or so.
