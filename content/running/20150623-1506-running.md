Fresh and bright. So I had to keep my pace up to stay warm. Generally good. Some tightness at the top of right quad. Heart rate rather high. I guess I'm not over whatever laid me low yesterday--I still have a mild pain at the top of where my kidney is. 

Note to self: yesterday my blood pressure was rather high (156/85) but the doc said that's a normal response to pain. 

All in all, I don't feel too bad.
