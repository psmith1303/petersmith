Ran 15 km in 84 minutes and felt solid. 

Well I guess this means I'm doing long runs again (it's all relative). The plan was to do 5km easy, 5km moderate, and 5km easy again. In actuality, allowing for traffic lights etc, that's what I did. 

A few aches as I've not done that kind of distance in a while (Achilles, right hip). But nothing worrisome. 

Warming day. Decided to measure my water loss ... 1.1 Kg. that's a lot is sweat. Once I get up to 21 km runs I'll start to take water with me.
