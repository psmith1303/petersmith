Run 73 of 83. That means there is only two weeks of training left (5 runs x 2 weeks). 

This, as is often the case, was hard.  Having already spent an hour with Kat today doing lunges etc, I was feel thrashed.  

So what did I do? Hills!  And a sprint! 

As I taper, my volume is reducing, but the intensity is still up there. Maybe too 'up'. I think I should ease up a little from Monday. 

I'll also lay off coffee so it will have max effect on race day.
