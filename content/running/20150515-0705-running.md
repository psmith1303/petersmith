 The plan said "Run 3 km" so that's what I did. 

I wanted to this run with intensity, but I struggled to average 5:18 min/km. I felt I was working, but the pace never came. It always seems to be that way with early runs (by, early I mean runs that take place within 30 mins of getting up, rather than say some time like 4:30 in the morning). My body just isn't awake, I guess. 

And now for a day of scholarly writing.
