The weather is magnificent. It is hard to believe that a tropical cyclone is heading our way. Blue skies. Almost no wind. Not so humid. It's brilliant. 

Took the run relatively easy. Trying to work on my posture; leading with my hips rather than sticking my rear end out. Also working on kicking my heels up, rather than pushing my feet forwards.
