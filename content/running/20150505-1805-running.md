A little slower than last time, and I wasn't pushing as hard as I have been. I actually had some energy to pass someone in the last 800m. Normally, I can barely hang on.

So, I can't say this was a hard hard run. Just effortful :) I actually felt more worn out after yesterday's long run. 

I must be getting fitter. 

It is dark during the run me, and that always makes me a bit more cautious.
