That was pleasant. A grey day; neither warm nor cool. 

Trying to stay in heart-rate zone 2, 137--157, is tricky. First, my run starts with a we hill. Second, I'm still half asleep when I start, so I'm a little 'fuzzy'. And final, I have to resist the urge to push it. 

Well I'll keep working on this base for another 10 days or so, then I'll start adding in some other types of workout.
