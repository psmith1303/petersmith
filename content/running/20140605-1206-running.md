Is that a tempo run? Most if it was done at close to my lactate threshold heart rate (265 bpm) even though my speed (not pace) was 8 Km/hr. 

Set the treadmill to random, level 20, speed 8 Km/hr. The incline varied between 9 and 15 degrees. 

Took a break after 20 minutes until my HR went down to about 120 bpm

Overall, I'd say, "Phew".
