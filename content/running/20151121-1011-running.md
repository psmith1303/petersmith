To the tunes of 1980 (not the 1980s) I did some light hill work. Taking easy :)

Felt good at the start of the run. At about 1 Km I was noticing the impact of yesterday's session with @Kat. My hamstrings were tired (split lunges) and my shoulders were achey (Arnie shoulder press). Coming down Mt Eden my quads were whining (goblet squats). Nevertheless, it was a good run. 

A little wet. Had the company of a jack Russell terrier (and its owner) going up Mt Eden. The dog was keen to follow me and dragged its own up the hill faster than she was aiming for.
