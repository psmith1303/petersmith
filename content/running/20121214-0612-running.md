Ran early to beat the heat (tick). Got a bonus of lighter traffic too. 

Normally my pace when listening to music is faster than when listening to 'the spoken word' such as podcasts or books.  So, considering I was listening to Cryptonomicon, I'm pretty happy with this run which is a second or two faster than my average pace.

Achilles L 1/10 (yay). Odd twinge on outside of R ankle, but went away after a few Km.
