A good run (ahead of median on this route, that I've now done 38 times). 

There was a joyous sense of cool in the air as I set off, but by the first 1Km I was feeling quite toasty. It's going to be a lovely sunny day. 

It was like Piccadilly Circus at Mt Eden Village--runners all over the place. The public holiday certainly brings them out. Most were going in directions different to me, but I did manage to catch a lone rabbit and a pack of three. 

Achilles was feeling tight but not sore. 

Really happy with today's run.
