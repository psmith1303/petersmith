Back in Bournemouth! It's been a long time since I lived here properly, so I ran to the hits of 1974; the year I left. 

The beach promenade has quite a few runners and cyclists on it, despite/because of the early hour. 

I could of kept running on the flat, but went up on of the zig-zags up the cliff. 

I don't know when/if I'll ever return to my childhood home again.
