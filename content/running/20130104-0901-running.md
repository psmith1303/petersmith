It felt cool when I set out, but by the end of this run I was definitely warm. 

Didn't intend to be this slow, but my legs had a very distinct view on the matter ... And they had their way. I guess I'm still recovering  

So that's four days of 'miles'. I've never had a streak of more than three days, so I'm in uncharted territory now (for me anyway, I've a way to go to catch up with folk like @maurice_t and @lisa_b).
