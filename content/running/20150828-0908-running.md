Run 38 of 83. Hills. After a good workout with Kat, I went for a trot up Mt Eden. Feeling good ... yet I took it s bit easy (comming just ahead of my median pace for this route). 

Actually, I should say, FEELING GOOD. 

Excellent weather, so I got some really good views from the top of the Mount. 

Now to recharge my batteries ahead of Sunday's long run.
