Got out a little early for this run because Summer has arrived; my idea was to avoid the heat if the day. (It’s all relative, I know). 

Still, I was definitely warm and sweaty by the end of the run. 

An easy run. I’m still feeling my legs a little from Friday. Generally the body felt okay. Knee, hip, ankle all seemed to be behaving.
