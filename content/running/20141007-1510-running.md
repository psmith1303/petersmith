Another stunningly good day in the Habour City. A lovely run in the sun. 

Working on my gait and hip position. No more trying to get down to a 180 turnover. I'm going back to my natural rhythm of 190+. I can feel a more mid foot strike happening, and less of a heel strike. 

Kim will probably recall my little legs turning over quickly from a half-marathon around St Heliers. Well, I'm trying to get back to that.
