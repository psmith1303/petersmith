Ran 32k in about 2:54 hours and felt great. 

Caught five rabbits. 

Really happy with my last 9k (from St Helliers). Was a little flat in the middle despite @andrew_e's comment :)

Achilles 1/10 (both). Some tightness in left shin. Abductors/adductors felt a bit tight later in the run. Glutes felt tired in the last 2-3k.  All good really. Plenty of time to work on these before Rotorua.  

@tago and @louise_s put some perkiness into my run. Thanks. 

Now for a shower and some tuna.
