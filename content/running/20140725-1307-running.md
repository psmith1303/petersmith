An easy outing ahead of my 2 o'clock class. 

So, the truth about my treadmill runs this week. I need a lot of stuff to get in and out of this building. Keys. Cards. It's a bit like Fort Knox. But I forgot to bring in my running belt (except for today). With no pockets it's too hard to run with all that stuff and my phone etc.  So, the gym and the treadmill were an easy option.
