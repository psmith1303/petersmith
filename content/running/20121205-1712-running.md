If it is Wednesday day, then it must be Shoe Science 5k day. As I'm scheduled for 11km today (as I am most Wednesdays) I begin with an easy 5km around the Domain (6:06 pace) to Shoe Science. 

Then it is 5-ish km with the folk from Shoe Science (5:03 pace). And I jog home (1km at 6:22 pace---we'll there is a wee hill on the way). 

Tonight's Shoe Science run was also around the Domain. It looks like they are setting up for the Coca-cola Christmas Carols in the Park. (Are there non-Christmas carols?)  

Was overtaken by the same two guys three times on the run, but I never overtook them once ... They kept getting lost. 

Rainy, hot, and humid. 

Achilles still 2/10. Few aches (no pains) from yesterday's gym session. Aimee (my trainer) must be doing something right :)

Now I just need to fit
