A quiet and misty day in Central Auckland. The mist cleared a bit about 2/3 of the way up Mt Eden. Ho, a 'rabbit'. A little more gas and I overtook him before the summit. 

Did the mount a under 6:00 min/Km. I think I'd like to do it at gMP (a smidgen quicker than 5:00). Perhaps that should be a goal for this training cycle. It would certainly move my lactate threshold. 

Oh, yes the heart rate monitor is working great. The new strap did it. Apparently these soft straps only last about a year with my frequency of use. 

And now, time for some bacon but ties for breakfast.
