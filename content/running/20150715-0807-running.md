Run 6 of 80. Hmmm, I think my other NB880s might be shot. Certainly, in this new pair my foot felt better (well, less loaded). 

The lightest of rain made this a refreshing run. 

The distance of this run isn't quite right. I didn't have a strong GPS lock at the start. Doh!  I didn't check before I started. You can see it at the start of the trace. I think the run was about 400m shorter ... Maybe 600m. 

But what is 600m between friends (Answer: quite a lot at the end of a marathon).
