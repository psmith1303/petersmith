Run 40b of 83. Ignore the GPS trace. The time and distance are correct. 'Strewth, that was a surprise. 

I chased a woman called Jo for the first couple of kilometres, then I tried to make a break for it. She stayed with me for another kilometres, and then she slipped behind me. But for the last 2 kilometres I was sure I could hear her just behind me ... so I kept going. 

After last week's good showing, I thought I might be able to shave 15 or 20 seconds of my time. But to do more than a minute. Whoohoo. 

I did my ASICS Road Tester shirt proud (even though I forgot my hat). 

#ASICSnz @asicsnz #GoRunIt 

Happy happy happy. 

I forgot to say that last week I won a spot prize (wine). Always nice to win :)
