As I was walking back from my morning coffee with my Princess, I noticed a rainbow. My first thought was, "How pretty".  My second thought was, "Bad weather is meant to be moving in perhaps I should run earlier rather than later". By the time I got home there were large black clouds stacked to the west. 

"Hmmm, so let's do it"

I pushed this a little, hence my new 'PB' on this route. All with and average HR of 156. Nice. 

I'm reading the book that @mark_c gave me (by Jack Daniels) and I think I need to focus more on my heart rate and what that is doing (rather like @penhryn or @fellrnr). 

Oh well, a good run.
