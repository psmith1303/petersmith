It's going to be hot and humid today (ahead of the rain that is forecast for this afternoon).  I was pretty sticky by the end of this run. 

I tend to stick my bum out when I run, so I tried tilting my pelvis forward throughout this run. My abs feel like they've had a good workout. 

And now for some fried eggs for breakfast.
