Out with the HRR. A bit of a shorter and slower run than last week. 

But that's okay as I added on a few more Kilometres to get an after 9:00pm run in and a full moon run in.  It's overcast tonight, so I'm trusting the full moon is up there somewhere. 

Gotta love @smashrun #badges. 

It's also good that the run was short as I plan to do a #parkrun on Saturday. So I won't blow out my weekly mileage target by too much.
