Ran 10 km In 50:46 and felt good. 

In contrast to my last run, this was a hot one. I pushed it a bit, spurred on by Mark Patterson's 10 km PB today. Wow, I've just calculated that he was more than 90 seconds per kilometre faster than me. Very nice work Mark. 

Maybe next week I'll try an all out effort on the flat ... But then again maybe not.

A lovely run all told. Good weather and not too much traffic.
