Twenty seconds faster than last week, bad under 21 minutes too. 

I thought I was really flagging from about 3 km, but there was only about 5 seconds difference in my pace. Powering through as usual. Not wise. 

Hammy is a wee bit off ...

I think I have a better understanding of what's going on with my hamstring. Doing a bit f running I am strong in many areas. Alas I am also weak in many areas. I'm out of balance. So I can "quite happily" do a pile of, say, split squats because if my running strength; but in doing so I really overload my hammy. Combine that with a bit of tolerance for pain (and insensitivity too), and there is a recipe for some woe. 

So I need to be more moderate!
