Run 11 of 80, and what a Spring-like day for a run. Super. 

Got beaten by one whippet and successfully fought of another. You'll see my pace pickup around the 7 km mark. 

The runners super-highway that is Tamaki Drive was awash with runners and walkers, most of whom seemed to be going in the opposite direction to me. 

My foot continues to feel better, and I think I well over my calf pull.
