Run 23 of 80. Hills. Hills on tired legs. Before doing this run I did an hour (90 mins really) workout with Kat. There was a bit if leg work involved (squats etc) and my legs were like lead as soon as I started running. It must be good for me.  

There were dark clouds in the distance when I set off. By the time I got back I looked like a drowned rat. 

I really was on autopilot for that run. I've no real recollection of it.
