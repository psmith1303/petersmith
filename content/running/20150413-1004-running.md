The weather is cold, wet, and a bit windy. Super stuff. 

Did loops as I was sure if I was up to 21km. Loops would have allowed me to bail without a long walk home. 

Slowed down more than I had hoped on the last few kilometres, but not as much as I expected. So that was good. 

Totally stuffed up the scheduling with Andrew. My fault entirely. The run was so
Much poorer because of that :(
