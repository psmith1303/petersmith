A grey and beautifully quiet day, this Queen's Birthday holiday (those outside NZ, don't ask ... I don't understand it (and I'm English)). 

Following a message from @lisa_b, that seemed to be a coded instruction to be more crazy on my run, I found myself dancing along the middle of some of the major thoroughfares of Auckland. Thank heavens it was a holiday or I'd have been arrested. 

And it was fun!  Thanks Lisa. 

Took it easy after yesterday's 11 Km. Hammy was occasionally grumpy.
