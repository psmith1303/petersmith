So, for a change, I headed on over to the Domain for a easy couple of laps around the many cricket pitches. 

Lots of teams and supporters were out. Quite a few people were grabbing good positions on the boundaries for games later this afternoon. 


Nice.  

As for the run; well this is the nearest I've been to trail running as I was on the grass for most of the time. 

I'd do this route more often, but there is a tricky junction to cross where I always have to wait (not that I'm impatient or anything). 

All in all, a lovely run.
