Stepping outside I was surprised by how fresh it was ... 3Â°C. I think I was the only person out in shorts and a T-shirt. The few other runners I saw all had jackets, leggings, and hats. 

Rush hour, and that meant I needed to stop at many of the junctions I crossed. I need to find a less 'interrupted' route. 

Part of this route went through Mile-End. It has a large Hasidic Jewish community and I saw many with their hats etc. 

Still trying to keep it easy. Though I did notice that I slowed a lot over the course of the run. Hammy feels okayish ... unused.
