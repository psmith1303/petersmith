A pleasant run around the local neighbourhood which includes an area called Mile-end. It has a large  orthodox Jewish community. There are a lot of Jewish schools and businesses in the area. What surprised me--and I'm not sure why--is that there seem to be some begging going on by people dressed like Orthodox Jews. 

Not a bad run. The day after my last run I had some aches in my hammy. So I kept this one particularly easy.
