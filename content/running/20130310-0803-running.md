I ran 8.4k in 38:15 and felt super (and hot). 

There is always a lot of waiting at the start if you want to be near the front. I guess I was hanging around for an hour ...  boring. 

Really happy with the run. The first K or two were tense, so many people!! Then it opened up. 

For the last couple if K I fought of a young woman who tried to pass me. Then with about 800m to go I open up and took off. I felt great.  

I think i came in 2nd out of the 600 or so runners from the Uni. Yay.
