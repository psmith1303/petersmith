Run 62 of 83. Spring is here. Many stops for water. That put a dent in my time. 

This mid-week mid-day long run was fuelled by two cups of white coffee. Simulating running on empty; which I noticed in the second half. All through this run I had to concentrate to keep under my Goal Marathon Pace, and at the end, I had to put in some extra effort to stay on target. 

It'll be interesting to see what the heart rate data says. 

Beautiful out. But, the heat made me 'a bit' sweaty and my heart rate monitor belt was itchy.
