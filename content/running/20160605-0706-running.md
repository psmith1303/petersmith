Not my best run, although I hit my target pac nicely. 

No, the problem was dinner last night. There must have been some lobster in the sauce that accompanied the sawfish. Now I like lobster, but it really doesn't like me. So, I barely got any sleep last night, and throughout the run I was fighting off the gingerbread man.

Still, it was a lovely route around some very picturesque locations. The weather was good for a long run ... overcast with the occasional light shower. It would have been an outstanding run if it weren't for my tummy. Instead it was all a bit grim and a slog. 

I'm glad I did it.  Now for a 7 hour drive back to Montreal (with a tummy that is pretty dodgy).
