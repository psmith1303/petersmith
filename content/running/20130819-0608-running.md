Ran 29.73 in 2:30:17 and felt okay. 

This was almost a DFN. Around 10k my right abductor was getting twitchy, and by 14k it was rather annoying. I was thinking about aborting at that point. But, as I played with my gait and the style of running, I found I could calm it right down. I think it might be the Jacobs ladder that has wound it up. 

I'm seeing Katie later to work on my hammys etc, so I might get her to stretch them out. That'll help

Caught one fit looking rabbit going up the hill at Westend. Me, on a hill, catching a rabbit, half my age. Yikes, I'm getting fitter. 

In between thinking about my abductor, spent time thinking about today's class. 

Weather was nice. A bit overcast. A light wind. Some super views over to a cloud shrouded Rangitoto. I was going to take a picture ...
