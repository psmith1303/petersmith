Run 29 of 80. Managed to miss the rain. Most surprised. 

Kept pretty much within my target heart rate (under 158 bpm). Average pace seems okay ... 5:20 min/km. 

Crossed paths with hundreds of runners (including the YMCA packs). I tried to wave and give a cheery "Good morning" to each of them. 

After I stopped my right patella was a bit off whilst walking. I need to do some exercise to strengthen that. 

I actually ran out of water. I put 1L in my Camelback, but that went dry at 25 km :)  Next long run I think I'll go for 1.5L. 

All in all, a good run.
