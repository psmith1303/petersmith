In the groove--musically and runningly. My RPE was under 10 except for a couple of points on the hills. 

Lovely jubbly. 

Achilles is a little twitchy after yesterday's hills. I guess I'm not really ready for hill work yet. That's okay. I can work within that limitation. 

Super weather. Sunny with a cool breeze. 

Heart rate is nice. I'm somewhat envious of the extra data @andrew_e gets from his new Garmin 620. 

Righty oh. Time for afternoon tea.
