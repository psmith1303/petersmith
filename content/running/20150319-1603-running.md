An easy and short run. 

As some folk know, I'm doing the 'towering stairs' on smashrun. That means for six months I increase my mileage by 10 miles. In other words, over six months I increase the distance I run by a total of 60 miles. 

The goal this month is to do 170 km. As I'm nearly at 130 km already , and as I have two long runs (totalling 32 km), I only need another 10 km or so ....  

There is no point in doing much more than 170 km this month as that just pushes up the total I need to do in all the following months. So, I see some short but intense runs in my (near) future.
