Recovery run, having rolled/sprained my ankle in Friday (whilst walking!). Some grumbling from the left ankle, just below the bone, but it settle a bit during the run. That said, for such a leisurely pace, my heart rate was way high, suggesting some pain management was at work. I am interested to see how it feels through the rest of the day.
