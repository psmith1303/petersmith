Run 32 of 80. A noticeable headwind on the outward leg. No rain although I could see it sweeping across parts of town. 

Still got a cold. It is getting better but I'm still rather meh. Little energy for this run ... Hence the slightly sedate pace. I just couldn't pull it together. I guess this cold has run me down a bit.
