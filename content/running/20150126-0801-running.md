To day is Auckland Anniversary Day, which is a stat (statutory holiday, for my non-NZ chums). So it is pretty quiet around town. Even the cafe Mecca of Kingsland has very few places open for coffee :(

A pleasant outing. Cooler than yesterday. That's my long run for the week. 

Still working on my posture.
