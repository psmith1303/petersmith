Ran 7k at under 4:45 pace. Only another three fast-ish runs like this needed before the end of the month to get my Roadrunner badge from smashrun. 

Hence my shorter than usual run today ... I have three more back-to-back days of running. 

So, how was it?  Okay. Hammies were feeling a bit beaten up after Mondays massage. Left knee has been niggling all day, but running didn't make it worse. Right hip hasn't settle. Achilles, good. Back, good.
