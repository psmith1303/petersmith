"Mad fools and Englishmen go out in the midday sun."

That's me. 

Warm and sunny. I wonder if it will stay like this for Christmas. The weatherman says not. 

So, after a six week break from running, and generally being lazy, I did this route a little slower than my median time. Hmmm. So I have lost a bit of condition, and put on a few Kgs. After my last run on Friday I ended up with some mild DOMS in my quads. After today's run both hammys are feeling 'tight' to say the least. I bet they'll be sore tomorrow. 

On the plus side, I'm sleeping well and my ribs barely ache. 

Still haven't gotten around to drawing up my 2015 running plan yet.
