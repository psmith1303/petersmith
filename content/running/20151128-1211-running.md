Rather humid, and I felt like I was sweating buckets. 

Concentrating on getting my heels to my butt more. That moves my landing towards the forefoot and stops me over-striding. 

Some slight niggles. Right hammy at the start and right quad after the uphill (4Km). My shoulders definitely feel the consequences of yesterday's gym-garage workout.
