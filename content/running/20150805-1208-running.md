Run 21 of 80. A bit wet to start, but the rain had pretty much stopped by the end of the run. 

So, this was really by goal marathon pace. At this point in the programme, it does not seem like a horrible think to do for 43-ish kilometres. I'm feeling on track. 

If I have a worry, it's that I'm noticing my Achilles. Time for some her drops ...
