Well the official times aren't in yet, but I'm betting this was a new PB. Because I'm slow stopping my clock, the official time is always less than mine ... and by my clock it's a PB. 

Yay. And it was windy too!!

Mind you, I did feel a bit vomitty at the end, but that could be my cold. 

Well it's Pancake Tuesday, so I'm off home for some yummy pancakes with sugar and lemon, and maybe a few with maple syrup.
