Rocking my out to the sounds of 1978. 

That's one way to pass the time of day. 

At about 7 km, a runner started to pass me. Instead if putting my foot down, I went for plan B; match speed and chat. Good plan. 

Laurier--that was her name--was good company. We ran and talked for about 2 km (until she reached the end of her run). We both ended up being faster.
