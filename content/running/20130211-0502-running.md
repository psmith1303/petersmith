Elegant. 

No, that's not a typo. About half way round (with encouragement from @Penrhyn, @honestjim, and @tago) the word elegant came to mind. That's how I feel about this run. There is no smiley for that. 

A cool start in the dark, led on to a magnificent morning run. 

Pace ... spot on all the way. So much so that I threw in some extra hills at the end. That blew my target pace out of the water. But, what the heck; I could have stayed on the flat and romped home, but the hills felt good. 

(I did 5:30 pace, the goal was 5:25. I think I'm getting better)
