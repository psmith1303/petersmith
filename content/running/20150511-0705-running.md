Today's goal was to do 21 Km faster than last week. No long slow run today. Instead, I wanted something a bit snappier. 

The were a few sub-5 splits in there, but many more were closer to 5:20. 

But it was work. By 19 Km my quads were feeling shot and the bit of a hill at the end really did me in (slow slow pace). 

All in all, despite this being a good run, I feel underprepared for the Huntley Half-marathon in two weeks.
