Seems @andrew is resting after yesterday's run. So I'm off out with the young guns ... but I'm early. What shall I do?

I know; a 2 Km slow run at hard effort (random, level 20, 8 Km/hr). 

Yeessss.

This included a 3 minute cool down at the end. Level 20 doesn't seem quite so bad. Heart rate didn't hit 166 (lactate threshold), but came close.
