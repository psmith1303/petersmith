A fine run after yesterday's 'sprint'. 

It's tricky trying to get my cadence and heart rate 'right'. My normal cadence is about 190+ steps per minute and I'm trying to get it down closer to 180. But, on the flat, I find it hard to get my heart rate up to, say. 158. When I try and work harder my cadence goes up. I need to master the art of lengthening my stride ... But with my short legs it's hard.
