Ran 4.7k in 21:03 and felt good. 

Started gently-ish and soon got into a 4:11-ish pace. But round about the 3.5k mark I began to flag. At 4k @mark_c (who started late) glided past me ... such nice form. 

Overall, happy with the outing (after yesterday's 32k). 

Now to get my free drink and then to trot home.
