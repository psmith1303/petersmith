Ran 21k in 1:45 and felt great. 

Caught four rabbits. Around about the 7k mark I saw a woman about 300m ahead of me.  Over the next 3k I wound here in at at steady-ish 5:00 pace. Decided to draught her for a bit, but she slowly sped up to about 4:33. That was way ahead of my target pace, so we started talking (a bit) and got the pace back to 5:09-ish. Stayed with her until my turn around. 

Great day out. 

Achilles 1/10, but I did get a twinge when I sprinted across the road.
