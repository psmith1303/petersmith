Stunningly pretty day for a run. Went across the bridge to the trail between Sherbrooke and Magog. Only ran a tiny part of the path--it's 40 or so Kilometres. But I enjoyed the bit I did run. Trails. River views.  And some stairs.  

I feel ready for Newport. I can done the instance, but my pace won't be great. Still, my goal is to do it without upsetting anything.
