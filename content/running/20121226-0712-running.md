Yesterday's most excellent lunch (turkey with all the trimmings) weighed heavily on my mind (and on my stomach). So i took this run a little easy. 

Typical Auckland Christmas weather ... heavily overcast, rain, and a bit of wind. Most refreshing as I worked off some if yesterday's excesses. No doubt the hot summer weather is just around the corner. 

Nice to get a shout from @andrew_e as I was run. It help me along.
