Run 14 of 80. My long run calls and it is starting to rain. Thank heavens for Body Glide. 

Well, um not sure why, but that was a tedious run. Yes, I was totally soaked, but that doesn't normally bother me. It was cool out, but I soon warmed up. It was just ... tedious. I guess all runs can't feel good. 

Any way I'm home now and my darling wife has made ginger cake and a pot of green tea. That'll refresh my spirits.
