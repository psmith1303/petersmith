The forecast for today looks pretty good, so I got out early for a trot around bits of Mersea Island. 

A pleasant run, albeit a little exciting as parts were on country roads (no pavements) and fast traffic. The result was some close encounters with stinging nettles. 

Such a quaint and pretty village. My sister-in-law starts work today as the Town Clerk for West Mersea. Nice.
