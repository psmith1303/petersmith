Very quite around town. No doubt the fact that it is Easter Sunday has some influence on that. Just a few cafes open. 

Dark clouds as I set off, and 200m from the end of my run, the rain caught up with me. 

I'm still working on picking my feet up and position my hips correctly. But as I run pass windows, I still have the impression I'm sticking my rear end out ...

Legs still a bit DOMSy so I think I'll slide tomorrows  long run to Wednesday (Tuesday being set aside from the 5k 'fun run' at O'Hagan's.
