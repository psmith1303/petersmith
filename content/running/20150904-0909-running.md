Run 43 of 83. After yesterday's mud-week long run (with hills) and today's workout with Kat (who turn my legs to jelly doing walking lunges) I decided to forgo running up Mt Eden today. 

Instead I did a gentle jog to the Physio (preventative care) followed by a bit of a slog up Parnell Rise. Consequently, today's run was only 100m if ascent compared to the 190m of my Mt Eden loop. 

Feeling a bit fatigued still. Ah well, tomorrow is a rest day.
