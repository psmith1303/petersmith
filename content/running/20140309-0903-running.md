Started out at about 4:08 which felt fine. Hip was a bit twinges by about 4 Km, and then I slowed down just a smidgen. Nevertheless, this has to be a PB by at least 45 seconds ... I don't have the official time. 

Start out very overcast, with a chance of rain. But it progressively cleared up. Rather sunny now. 

All in all a good out; albeit hard work
