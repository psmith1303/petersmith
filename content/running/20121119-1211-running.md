Hot, and good. 

Caught two rabbits around about the 3.5km mark. Another rabbit got away at about 9km. Was thoroughly caught by a whippet at about 8.5km. I tried to keep up with him, but when Runmeter started complaining about me doing 4:17km/min, and not the 5:00-5:15 I had planned, I thought I'd let him go. Achilles 1-2/10. That serves me right. 

A very smiley run all told. Crazy mix must have helped.
