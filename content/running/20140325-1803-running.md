Yee haa.  I finally broke 20 minutes (19:49). That was work. No flow, just effort. I was lucky enough to have some good people ahead and behind me ... Nothing like the threat of being overtaken, or seeing someone pulling away to motivate one to 'dig deep'. 

Stunning evening for the run. There was some wind, and that made the run back along Halsey Street extra tough. 

So, off to celebrate; will it be an OJ or a ginger beer. Hmmm
