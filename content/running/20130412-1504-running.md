Ran 11.2k in 55:44 and felt good. 

Hard work ... in a good way. Good improvement over my median time, but my best time on this route will take some beating. Until, I can do better on the uphill at the start, I expect I'll not break my PB on this route, or until the traffic lights are more good natured. A good workout.
