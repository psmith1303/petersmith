Last little run before Auckland. Having talked with my physio, I'm doing a somewhat radical taper. No running for the next two weeks. The plan is to give my hip a good rest. 

That doesn't mean no exercise. No. I'll be hitting the stationary bike heavily to keep up my aerobic fitness.  The bike doesn't load my hip up :)

I guess we will see how that works out. 

So, I'll see you all back on the track in November.
