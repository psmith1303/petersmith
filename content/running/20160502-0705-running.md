Ran along the Rappahannock Cannal and then along the Rappahannock River. Yesterday's pizza weighed heavily. 

Pretty route, but the visitors running map I was using was a little 'vague'. Consequently, there were a few wrong turns. 

A little light drizzle/mist.  Refreshing. Odd to think that a few days ago we were in the low 30s.
