Run 33 of 80. Can that be right!  I'll soon be half way through my training for the Auckland marathon. Now, which half of the training is the easier part?

Still got a bit of a cold, so a bit meh. But the weather is great and .... wait for it ....  I've got a new pair of ASICS Gel Nimbus 17.  The joys of being an @asicsnz roadtester. So it was a mighty fine run. Great views from the top of Mt Eden and my feet were feeling loved by my new shoes. 

If the current stream of research on the importance of how shoes feel when on the foot and running (as opposed to being for a particular foot type) then these shoes are going to work out brilliantly. They are both extremely comfortable and suits foot type. 

They worked well on today's hill run, and I'm keen to see how the go on Sunday's long run.
