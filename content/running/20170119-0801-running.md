Ran 20 km in 1:50:34 and felt good. 

Nice to be out with my brother. He can be quite chatty, which makes the miles pass by quicker---thanks Bill. 

I thought the weather would be a lot wetter, but it was dry with just a few specks of rain at the end. 

Abductors tight in the last couple of Kilometres.
