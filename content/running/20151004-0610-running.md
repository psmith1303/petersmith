Run 64 of 83. The training is working. All my runs (including my long runs) are at my goal marathon pace or better. So I must concentrate on not getting cocky and stuffing myself up. 

I do notice on these longer runs at slightly faster paces my hip flexors get rather tight. I see more stretching in my diary for the next four weeks. 

Lots of runners out along Tamaki Drive. I tried to have a cheery "Hello, I hope you're having a good run" for everyone.  Generally, I get a good response. 

I judge my distances so that my long runs end on the flat; no running up Symonds St. But it does make for s tiresome walk home. Then again, it's a good cool down and s chance to grab a coffee and some bagels.
