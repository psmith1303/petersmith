Didn't quite have a GPS lock at the start so the numbers are a little unreliable. 

Great to run at this time on a Sunday. The traffic (vehicular and pedestrian) is light. Not many runners out either. The biggest thing to watch out for are the folk strolling along with their lattes and the occasional party animal sleeping it off. 

Nice run. Really hard to get my heart rate up and my cadence down. A lot if this run was at more than 190 steps/min (95 strides/min). 

Of course, the hill helped to get my HR up :)
