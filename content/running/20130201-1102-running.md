Yesterday's session in the gym left me with some v.tired muscles: gluets, hammies, calves, etc. So this run was going to be interesting. 

It was work as I did 1200, 1000, 800, 600, 400, and 200 metre sprints with 2 minute recovery 'jogs'. It was hot and sweaty fun ..  which is unusual when by ones self.
