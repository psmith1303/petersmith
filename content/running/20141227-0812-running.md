My hammys me my quads felt that. 

The plan was to run with @jason, who is attempting to do 20 parkruns today. (Good on you, Jason). 

In reality I got sucked along at the start and then, as Andrew puts it, it is a matter of hanging on. 

I'm not sure I like the course. A bit trail-like in places ...  too much dappled light. Hmmm. 

But fun (despite the coffee van not being open).
