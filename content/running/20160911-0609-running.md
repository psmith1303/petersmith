A stunningly fine and fresh day here in the City of Sails. Some many great views of the city on this route:  gorgeous!

Ran trying to keep in zone 2 (137-157 bpm for me). It was hard to keep my heart rate over 137 when going down any hill. I need to work on that. 

Having now signed up for the Auckland marathon, this is something of a benchmark run. I'm over 30 seconds per kilometre slower than this point last year.  If I'm sensible, I should be able to shave 15 or 20 seconds off that in the next six weeks. 

With all my travelling,  my training has been a but fragmented. So I'm actually pleased with where I am.
