Run 58 of 83. Run by effort (rather than pace or HR). Tried to keep it between 2-3/5. As I was doing this after a workout with Kat, that didn't translate in a speedy run ... but it was to plan (which is good). If it hadn't been for the traffic lights, and stopping to get a stone out of my shoe, this would have been a median run. 

All good. 

Spring is definitely in the air, so I was a little warm and sweaty on this outing.
