Another super day in the City of Sails. Clear with some high cloud. Rain later, they say. 

Talking to one of the neighbours, I was sorry to hear that Robert (a central organiser in the 'hood) had died unexpectedly earlier in the year. 

That lead into a moribund conversation about how we are all getting older. 

So I'm glad I'm running; that makes it more likely I'll have more good days like today. 

NB. Saw Jerry Seinfeld at Spark(Vector) Arena last night. Outstanding. A great way to celebrate our wedding anniversary.
