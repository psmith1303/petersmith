Ah! English country roads. So narrow. No pavements. Now bern. Risky running when there is traffic on the road. 

Especially when there is me, a cyclist, two cars going in opposite, and all converging on the same place. Tight!

Helps to fight off the jet lag. 

Ankle/heel was noticeable at the start, but once I got my rhythm, it seemed okay.
