Ran 11k in 52:01 and felt like I had worked ...

... and I almost kept going to see how far I could push the distance at this pace. Managed to resist the temptation to slow down in the last couple of hundred metres (unlike @andrew_e who often accelerates away at the end). 

Phew. It would have been hard to have much of a conversation on that run. Ran down three rabbits. 

I wonder what the 'right' distance is for a short run. For a pile of historical and accidental reasons, I always think of my short runs as being 11k. But it was never a deliberate choice. Under FIRST most/all the non-long runs are less than 11k. Has anyone read anything on this?
