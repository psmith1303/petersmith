Oops. I accidentally selected 'tempo' for this outing instead of 'run'. So Runmeter kept suggesting I go faster (< 5:00) whereas my inner monologue  was saying "WTF, you should be >5:00). So I ended up pretty much on 5:00. 

This does feel like it is becoming my default (moderate) pace for this distance. It's also what I want my MP to be next year. 

Caught one rabbit. No whippets. 

Glorious day along Tamaki Drive.
