Still feeling somewhat blah. My cold, and in particular my sore throat, is keeping me awake at night. So I'm feeling fatigued and fuzzy around the edges. But, I'm possibly past the hump now. 

Smashing late afternoon for a run. Even though it's not even 18:00 yet, many of the restaurants are humming (in a good way).

Now for a drink or two ... when I have a cold I seem to drink gallons, but always feel dehydrated. 


Overall, a happy run.
