Run 48 of 83. Listening to Lynsey de Paul. Now that's a blast from the past. 

Feeling pretty sluggish as is evidenced by my overall pace. I did pick things up in the last kilometre; a young woman passed me and so I felt obliged to run with her for a bit ... before leaving here behind. 

It'll be interesting to see if my legs feel brighter on my long run tomorrow.
