A heavy legs run ... but the again, I didn't want to push the pace. So, lets call this one a win. 

It's been over a year since I've done this route. Strange running along Mt Albert Road and seeing the number of old villas that have been pulled down and replaced with brick-clad town houses. 

A few gentle hills. Left Achilles 2/10. Not used to hills, but I'll have to work on that for the Rotorua marathon.
