Run 22 of 80. After the wind and the rain last night I was expecting some challenging weather ... but I got brilliant sunshine, and nary a breeze. So much so that I nearly missed the turnaround as I was tootling along. 

Felt pretty good, and I'm particularly happy with my pace as it didn't feel to effortful. Mind you, looking at my heart rate I was a bit closer to my lactate threshold than perhaps I should have been. I really need to be able to crank out this pace for a sustained distance at about 145 bpm. 

Looking at my heart rate graph, that classic inexorable rise can easily be seen.
