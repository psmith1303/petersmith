Well that was fun. A mixed group from about 5:00  to 4:15 cruisers. 

Anyway, the goal was 5:00 and on the slightly downhill outward leg we hit about 4:50. Yay. 

The return leg was messier. A combination of the upward hill and the traffic lights put a spanner in the works and the overall result was about 5:26. 

But fun was had. There were eight of us all told.
