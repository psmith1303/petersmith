More YUPPY trails ... and I see that autumn has arrived in the Domain. Rugby posts and football goals have sprung up all over the playing fields. 


I spent a lot of this run thinking about lactate threshold training. As I understand it, to improve ones LT it is necessary to train at or above ones LT.  Other (lower intensity) training will have an effect on ones LT, but not much really. The classic ways to improve LT seem to be interval training or tempo runs (correct me if I'm wrong in any of this). BUT does it have to be running? I find Jacobs ladder a extraordinary effective way to get my heart rate over my LT. Will that (materially) improve my LT in regards to running?

Anyway, it was a solid run to day -- very autumnal.
