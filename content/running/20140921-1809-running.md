Considering I ran along one of the main roads, the traffic light gods where kind to me. 

I did pause the run tho', when i stopped to take a few pictures. 

The plan was to do about 7 km, but that drifted up-to 9 km; at the end of the run I did a bit extra as I was looking for the equivalent of a dairy. 

Warm. It's just about 8 pm and it's still 26 degrees Celsius. That 2 litres of water is looking dam fine.
