21:13. Iâ€™ll take that. 

A little slow at the start, then at about 1.5 km pony-tail guy passed me, and I used that as an excuse to pick up the pace for the next Km. 

A bit slower after that. 

In the last 300m a woman tried to pass me, but I dug in and kept ahead. All in all, a good Run and I donâ€™t feel knackered (nor us jy knee too bad).
