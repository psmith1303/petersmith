Ran 11 km in 59 minutes and felt good. 

Slipped this run in between showers. I say showers, they are torrential downpours really. A solidly run; noticeably faster in the first half. All good really. 

New shoes ... New Balance Zante with 'Fresh Foam'. Okay. Not as cushioned as I expected. Zero drop.
