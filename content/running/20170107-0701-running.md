Ran 19 km in 53:46 and felt good.

Out with Bill, which was nice. It honk he is a faster runner than me; he has put a lot of time and effort into his running and it has clearly paid off. 

Good day for an early run. I think it'll be hot later.

Now it's BBQ time. I'm going to do 6-hour pork ribs.  Hmmm.
