A somewhat illusionary run on NZ5 on its way back to NZ. I'm a traditionalist, in that I don't change my timezone until I arrive at my destination. But then again, when I look at the maps and stuff, I think there is a small window when it will be Friday (local time, wherever we are) as we cross the International Dateline well after midnight. 

That's the only way I can keep my streak alive in the face of the International Dateline.

Talking to the stewardesses, beforehand, they seem rather bemused by the whole idea. Mind you, the have obviously faced the similar problem if people possibly 'missing' their birthdays. 

Right, the local time in LA is 2:10 am on Tuesday, and the local time at this point in the Pacific is 00:10. So, it's the 26th. The streak lives.
