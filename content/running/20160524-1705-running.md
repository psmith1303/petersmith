Phew. What a scorcher. It's 28Â°C or there snouts. I couldn't run in the morning as I had a workshop to attend first thing. 

Decided to walk up one of the longer hills (not too steep, but I'm keen not to overload my hammy; hills are tough on them). It's a tactic I might adopt for the Newport 10-miler. 

I missed my turnaround, hence the odd square at about the 3 km mark.
