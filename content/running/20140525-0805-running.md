An easy run around the neighbourhood.  Some hills, but decided against doing Mt Eden ... for which my achilles thanked me. 

It hosed down last might, so the streets seemed particularly fresh and clean. Pretty quiet out; a few other runners, but not many. 

Arrived home to find pop-overs in the oven.  Hmmmm
