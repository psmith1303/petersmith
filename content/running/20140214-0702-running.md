Kept it easy ... Average heart rate was 130 and the maximum was only 150. Of corse that means my pace was pretty relaxed too at > 6:20 min/Km. Did I run to plan? Oh yes. Am I happy with it? Heck, yes. 

There seem to be a lot if folk around the domain who take their running seriously; training in groups; very lean bodies; compression socks. The seem to have beautiful running form. Nice to watch.
