Lovely run albeit with rather heavy legs. Overall, my pace was okay. 

Spent most of the run reviewing my writing plans for the next three months ... I've papers to complete. 

The city is still pretty quiet but there are hints that it is coming back to life. On K' Road, in particular, there were more sex workers than I've seen in a while.
