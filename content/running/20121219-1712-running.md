An easy first 'third' to this run (6:02). My it's hot. The second 'third' took a bit more effort and pace (5:09). And a relaxing (7:13 with hills) home. 

Did I say it was hot. Oh, yes. And not the dry heat of the high desert. No, this is the humid sticky heat of the sub-tropics. Energy sapping. 

But. And this is a big but (not a big butt). But, it felt like a mighty good/fun run. Jolly good. I can feel all the wonky/broken bits coming back into alignment and my groove returning.
