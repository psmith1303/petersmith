If it's over 30°C, do I need to warm? And why, after walking a kilometre at the end of my run do I not feel like I've cooled down. How to folk in hit climes manage?

So many questions. 

Saw a few others running along the waterfront, just like last night. No one seemed to be going fast :)

It's hard work running here, as you have to duck and dive around all the dog shit. 

I had planned to run first thing this morning (21°), but we were a little pushed for time ... We wanted to get to Herculaneum early (magnificent). That explains tonight's hot run. Well I had to do something whilst waiting for the restaurants to open at 19:30.
