DNF. 

Saw the physio today about my right ankle. Nothing other than running seems to bring the symptoms on. He thinks it might be the posterior tibial tendon. 

So he strapped it up and said give it a (5 km) go. It was fine until I hit some unmade pavement. After that, I could sure feel it. 

Run abandoned, I walked home (walking is fine).
