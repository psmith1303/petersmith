Ran 18 km in 1:45:03 and felt good. 

Earlier today we took a bit of a tickey tour on the Inner Link bus around the inner suburbs of Auckland. This run saw me going around some of the same suburbs, plus a view. Nice to have a change of scenery. 

Thirsty work ... Bolted down a couple of large glasses of water when I got back. That'll be the heat and the wind ...
