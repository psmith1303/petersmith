Lactate threshold test. I forgot how they hold the pace steady and increase the incline. At 10 degrees at 5:00 pace I called it quits. I was past my lactate threshold at that point ( it was over 13 when I stopped) so we had the necessary data. 

HR was 'only' 170. 

It was the lack of practice on hills ... Or knowing that we had the data ... that stopped me. Probably the latter.
