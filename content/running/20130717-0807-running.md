Ran 11.24k in 1:04:32 and felt very social. 

A bit of a trot wit @tago (who is taking it easy today). Great conversation.  The kilometres glided by. 

Not too hot, and not too cold. The porridge was just right. 

Achilles 1-2/10. I wonder if my other (main) shoes are shot. They've 450k on them ... Mind you I've just dumped my other (main) shoes which were up at 800k. 

Time for some shopping :)
