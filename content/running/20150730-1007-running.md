Run 17 of 80. I feel like I'm improving. If I can maintain this pace for another 33 km I'll be an exceedingly happy chappy. 

Cool clear crisp. Good running weather. 

I was surprised by how fast I went out. And even more surprised at the pace I managed to maintain. 

Note to self: Don't over cook it.
