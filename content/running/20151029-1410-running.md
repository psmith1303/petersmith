Run 78 of 83. Training for the 2015 Auckland marathon is over.  I think I'm good to go. 

I have a few niggles but who doesn't during taper time. If I have a worry it's the taping of my hamstring. My leg must be moving a little different as I can feel some fatigue in my groin/quad. I can probably stretch out on the day (fellrnr's Morton stretch) 

Lots of signs on Tamaki Drive about a major event and major traffic delays ... what could they be talking about. 

So my next post should be on Sunday at 6:00 when the marathon kicks off.
