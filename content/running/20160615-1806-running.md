Well, that has to be the furthest (distance, not climb) I have ever run. It was pretty much 4.5 Km of relentless 'up' with a short downhill at the end. Not steep, just relentless. I certainly was feeling it at about 4 km. The cinder track/road/path has a bit more 'slip' in it that I'm used to. That made it harder work too. 

I started at the back of the pack and made sure I didn't go out too hard. I'm glad I did that, otherwise it would have been not so much fun. 

Post run there was baguette, cheese, vegetables cous-cous, and beer from a local micro-brewery. Very French :) A very different feel to other post-race events (outside of Montreal). Mellow/chilled. 

(There was water, electrolytes, and protein shakes too---but most folk seemed to go for the food and beer). 

Happy, happy with my
