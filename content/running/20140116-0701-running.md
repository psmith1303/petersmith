Stopped just before 2km to chat with a friend who was filling his car up. That caused my heart rate to drop a bit. Nevertheless, I'm pretty happy with the consistency I'm get vis-a-vis my HR. 

I'm increasingly convinced that I gave two types of gaits. One is a high-speed shuffle; high cadence (190+) and, for whatever reason, it is how I do most of my running. I certainly can do a 4:30 pace with it (no, not today) but it is very 'forced'. I have come to control the range of movement a lot, and I think it relies a great deal on my calves. 

The other gait has much more of a toe-off (rather than me pulling my leg forward). It is a slightly slower cadence (175-180) and a longer stride. I also get more range if motion in my ankles; I don't control them so much ... I feel them moving around mor
