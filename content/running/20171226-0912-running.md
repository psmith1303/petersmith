I’m n total contrast to yesterday, the day started with it bucketing down. So we delayed my run by an hour until the rain had stopped. 

Felt hot and humid out, and I felt a bit sluggish—-yesterday’s turkey Christmas lunch perhaps. Certainly don’t feel the need for breakfast yet. 

Mind you, this run did drift out to 8 km, even though I only hoped to get to 7 km. So good then.
