Was about to set off on this run when I thought, "Looks like rain" so I went back for my Body Glide. Good thing too as it was headwinds and showers all long the return leg. 

Caught two rabbits (one with a pram--does that mean I caught two and a half?). Fought off two whippets. 

Legs were feeling tired on the last 3k. I miss-judged the turnaround and so this run was only 20k and not 22k. Grrrr and hooray. 

Achilles 1/2.  Yay.
