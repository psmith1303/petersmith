Ran 11k in 1:01:15 and felt good. 

As usual the plan was 5k warmup, 5k Shoe Science run, and a gentle 1k home. 

My goal for the Shoe Science run was a 4:38 pace. My actual pace was 4:41 and I'm happy with that. The 4:38 is predicated on a flat route, and this wasn't flat -- although @lisa_b or @nic_a might say otherwise; I think they might have mountain goat genes :)

It was stinky hot and rather humid. So very sweaty. 

Friday's run is going to be hard. I've been neglecting my interval running; but no more. But Friday is another day and my batteries should be recharged by then. 

Run well my friends.
