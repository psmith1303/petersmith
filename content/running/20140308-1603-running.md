A final run ahead of tomorrow's Round the Bays fun run. Will I beat my PR of doing the 8.4 Km course in under 37 minutes. Who knows ... I sure don't. But it will be fun finding out. 

It will be 25 years ago that my father, on his last visit to New Zealand did Round the Bays. Back then, the course was more like 10 Km and he did it in 76 minutes. Not bad for a 72-year old.  

To celebrate it my brother will also be running tomorrow. Yay!
