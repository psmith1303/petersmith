Well I pushed that more than the plan said. Maybe I'm riding on a high from yesterday, but it wasn't the goal. So a slapped wrist for me. 

A magnificent sunny day. Toasty. K'Road was pretty busy, so some weaving around. 

Had two programs tracking my heart rate. Both have pretty similar results  ... a couple of odd dropouts. I'm increasingly sure the monitor is off. Let's tighten the belt and see if that helps.
