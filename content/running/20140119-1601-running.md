This was my longest run in a couple if months, and maybe since my DNF at the Auckland marathon in November.  

The first 6km were fine. And the last 5km were okay, but a bit slower. However, at the end if this run there are a few short but steep hills. My right achilles certainly noticed those (1-2/10). I guess I'm not ready for hills yet. More rehab training :)  That's okay by me. 


It was a gloriously sunny day, so I waited until it clouded over in the evening. Ha. That made no difference. I still stewed in my own sweat and the humidity. 

Oh well, I can relax now.
