Started off easy; at least it felt that way. Certainly the first k was slower than the second k. Then I got a bit clobbered by the wind around Halsey Street. So, who knows what my final (official) result will be. 

At the end it seems to take me an age to stop my clock at the end of the run. And on a short distance like this 20 seconds makes a material distance. 

Got pipped in the last 100m by someone I had been ahead of for the last couple of k. 

These Brooks pure2 cadence shoes seem to be self tightening. I'll have to watch for that. 

All in all, a lovely late summer evening that warrants a cold ginger beer. 


Cadence was way off. Higher than 196 most of the time, but my focus was on running more than form.
