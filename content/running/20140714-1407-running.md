A short outing whilst Camtasia renders my latest video on MikesBikes (for next week's class). 

A happy run. How could be otherwise; I started by listening to George Thorogood singing "Bad to the bone". Showing my age perhaps ... As I segue into Pharrell Williams and "Happy". 

This run ends near the cycle track beside the B School. The track is a bit of a hill and about 250m long ... Hill repeats anyone?

Ankle 1/10 :)
