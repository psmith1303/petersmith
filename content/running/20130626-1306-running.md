Ran 20.6k in 1:43:46 and felt okay. 

This first 14k was pretty easy, and then it got harder. My HR in the last 5k is a bit all over the place because I adjusted the belt and the monitor never got a solid lock. But I think the general indication is that I was working harder. 

My goal was to try and keep to MP (5:00) and not to push it. Tick. The hill at the start put me out a little and it was a while before I hit MP. So for most of this run I was playing catch-up. 

Feel somewhat battered after this run. I set out with a cracking headache, which stayed with me throughout. My R achilles was at 2-3/10. Around 17k my right groin began to complain for no reason.  Ah well. But all in all it wasn't bad. 

Now, I need to get back to some reading ahead of next weeks conference.
