Out with the young guns again. Took it generally easy; central city running and the traffic lights in rush hour give few other options. 

Hip: rather good
Achilles: 2-3/10. Hmmm

But that means I can try a 16k on Monday, and maybe some 'spin' in between (yuk). 

On track for a gentle (no racing/PB) half marathon at the end of the month. 


All in all, I'll give this one a smiley face.
