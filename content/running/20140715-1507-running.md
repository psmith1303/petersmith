A bad bad run. 

I ran past my local runners emporium, and thought, "I could do with some new socks".  When I walked out, it was with some new socks and the lastest New Balance 880 shoes. How did that happen?  Mind you, they feel so good on my feet ..... hmmmmm

The rest of the run was uneventful (in comparison).
