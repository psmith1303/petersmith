Some light high cloud, but I would still call it a hot and sunny day. 

Very quiet out. It's still a stat/bank/public holiday. 

So Valley Road. The interesting thing about Valley Road is that it starts at the bottom of a valley. What a surprise. And, of course, I choose to run up Valley Road. 

I think my heart-rate will attest to the fact that I didn't push it (much). 

My hip and achilles feel fine. I wonder how the achilles will be tomorrow morning. 

Oh, well. Back to cleaning out the garage.
