Some easy Ks to end the running week. 

Well that was the plan ....

Decided against my regular 11k route as I tend to race along it. So I followed the motorway for a bit. At this time of day it's nice to be going faster than the cars. 

Despite a really good 80s mix, I found the run BORING. Gads. Was feeling fatigued too ... I don't know was yesterday's workout or Wednesday's run, but my groin was a bit achy to say the least. Blah all around. 

So much so that about 2k from home I just had to pick up the pace a get it over.
