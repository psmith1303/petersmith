I spent most of this run thinking about and feeling sad over the #brexit result. What an odd response from me. 

Lovely day for a longer run. It's a holiday here in Quebec and so it's quiet out. 

Did a magnificent trip around town and over the river. Felt really good about the run. Some ache in my right arch, but I know how to treat that.
