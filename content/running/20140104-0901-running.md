It feels as if this run is getting a bit easier :)  I was ahead of my median pace and I certainly wasn't trying to push it ... not pushing at all really. 

It was hot last night and today is cloudy and humid. So I feel sweatier (is that a word?).

Loads of folk out running. I wonder if they are mainly trying to get over the excesses of the holidays.
