Ran 5.2k in 27:04 and felt good. 

Almost left the meeting too late, and so it was a close call getting to the ferry on time. Made it with 90s to spare. 

Lots of little hills and I probably pushed it a little hard. Perhaps I should take tonight's Shoe Science run a little easy. 

Warm. As I sit here on the ferry the sweat is actually dripping off me.
