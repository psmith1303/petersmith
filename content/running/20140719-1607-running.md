Grey. Cool. Threatening to get wet. Beautiful running conditions. Apart from the hill, the route was chosen to be easy. 

Bond St--my hill of the day--wasn't too long or too steep. Just enough to get my heart rate up into zone 3 (above 158 and heading toward my lactate threshold of 165). 

I'm looking foward to tomorrow's long run of 6 Km. The plan is in action :)

Hip 0/10. Achilles 0.5/10. Back stable 2/10. 

Pretty darn good.
