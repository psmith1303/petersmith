Well, that tropical cyclone turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. I was looking forward to a run in the rain, but it had all passed by the time I got out. 

Something of an interrupted start. Had to stop, first to drop a book back to the library, then for some really slow traffic lights, and finally I had to stop to take a stone out of my shoe. 

By then I was in the waterfront, so it was a straight forward trot along Tamaki Drive. 

It's fascinating to see how my heart rate trends up over the course of the run, as my paces trends down (slows). Why is that? Why does my little  have to work harder to keep me going? It is, after all, a pretty flat route (well once I'm down on Tamaki Drive). Maybe I need to look this up. 

All in all, a solid run.
