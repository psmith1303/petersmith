I watched "Sing Street" last night; kinds in 80s Dublin forming a band. Do I was accompanied by my 'hits of the 80s' mix on this run. 

The gods of the traffic lights were not with me today; hence some rather long pauses. 

A fun run at moderate effort. Concentrated on kicking my heels and in my hip position/tilt. All good.
