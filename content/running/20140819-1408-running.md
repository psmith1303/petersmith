I'm a little ahead of where I should be for the week/month so keeping it short and to the point. If I get too far ahead of myself, the towering stairs that I'm doing for smashrun,com will end up too towering. I want to peak at about 240 Km per month in five months time ... not 300 or more. 

Anyway, this was a fun run. A wee bit wet and refreshing. 

I thought about Lisa's comment from the other day, about is it a grind doing the occasional short run (my rephrasing if her words).  For a long while I've been in a good space with my running (as my injuries come right). So I find all my runs rather good. Rarely I have a time crunch, but even then I'm not grumpy about the runs. It's curious as I did go through a phase of being rather blah about them. 

And now, marking calls. Yay!!
