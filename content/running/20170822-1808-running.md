Well that was way faster than I expected. I can feel my right arch, but it does feel hurt; maybe just unused. We will see tomorrow. 

I thought I'd be much closer to 25 minutes rather than 23. Let's hope I've not over done anything. 

Good to catch up with Bryan and other folk here. Missed Bill bring here. But he'll be back in December.
