Was thinking about doing a ‘steady’ 10km Run. But the combination of hills and traffic-lights on this route makes that too tricky. So I abandoned that idea after about 3 km

So strong headwinds along the motorway section, and a bit of rain too. A bit of a surprise given the sunshine when I set out. 

Felt my knee a bit on the uphills, but otherwise it was okay.
