Woohoo. That was fun. What a massive fun run. And it was fun. 

Not a rehab run; but my fitness has really fallen off. The last kilometre was a slog. I could blame it on jet lag, or on dehydration, but I think the truth is I've lost a bit of conditioning over the past three months. 

Time to get fit again. I just need to take care of my hamstring, and not come back too hard. 

Great to run with Anne, Brian, and all the other NACHO runners. Now for the after run party.
