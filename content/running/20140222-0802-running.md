Felt slug-ish. It might have been yesterday's speedier run (after nearly 2 weeks of slow runs). It might have been the excellent homemade pizza last night. It might have been the heat last night that made it hard to sleep. Whatever, the was no flow and grace in this run. I just ground it out. 

Que sera. Tomorrow is another day. 

Warm, humid, light drizzle. But there were still folk playing cricket in the Domain. Ah, summer is still here in any ways.
