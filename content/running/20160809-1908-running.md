Out with the HRR again. Tonight it was hill intervals. My quads were tired/tight going in; and they were shot coming out :)

The session was a warm-up run to the park, some drills, the hill repeats, 3 minute rest, then hill repeats again, a a short cool-down run. 

I think Thursday's run (by myself) is going to be very very gentle.
