I wasn't in a good mental place as I started this run. It's been an intense day in Christchurch--a long focused day, and I could have done without this run (however short). 

BUT there were a few bits of this run where I was incredibly light and silent on my feet. I felt light as a feather but very agile at the same time. And that was on some of the downhills. It was .... incredible. 

I was doing something very right, but I'm not sure how. A good run. 

(Back story, I had a few aches and pains from yesterday's PT session, but they evaporated away at times too).
