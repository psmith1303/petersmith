Run 9 of 80. My first real long run in a while. Now I really feel like I'm training for a marathon. 

Around 18 km my legs began to say "Are we there yet?"  Around 18.5 km I began to notice a blister on my right little toe :(  I must remember to use Body Glide on these longer runs.  

Fresh. So I didn't feel like I was overheating. That was nice. A bit blustery, but that comes with the stormy weather we've been having for the past couple of days. 

Time now for some afternoon tea.
