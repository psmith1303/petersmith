Woohoo. Ran the other way (downstream) along the river in Brisbane  

Hot. Cruisey pace, but sweating like crazy. 

Hammy is blah. But I don't think yesterday's outing stirred it up. Let's see how it feels tomorrow (rest/travel day). 

Saw a turkey running along the river bank. Does that make this a turkey trot?
