After yesterday's rain, today is really quite nice, and the roads we're quite quiet. It all made for a pleasant run. 

I felt rather sluggish at the start and I never managed to shake that leaden feeling. Looking at my average pace I would if hoped for something more like 5:15 than the 5:30 mins/km I actually did. 

This route does feature a few large-ish junctions. They sure can put a dent in your pace (and rhythm) if you don't get the timing right. 

But all in all, an okay run.
