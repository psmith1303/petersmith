Run 70b of 80. A little bit slower than last week, but within cooee--four seconds. 

Some interesting headwinds. 

I'm very conscious that I don't want to overcook anything this close to the marathon. Do I pushed it, but didn't Push It   (That's why I ignored Graham a bit). 

Nice to have @Mac here too. He did well.
