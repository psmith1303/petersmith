Well I was interest if, after three weeks of heart-rate based running, I still had my goal marathon pace in me. 

Short answer: Yes. 

The slightly longer answer is I was pleased at my heart rate during the run, but I did feel some tiredness in my ankle (not pain). 

And so I am happy to return to my heart-rate based training. Mind you, from next week I think I'll be adding in some sort of speed work once a week (tempo, strides, fartlek ... who knows).
