An easy trot to the hits of 1975. 

Don't want to over do it ahead of tomorrow's outing with @kim. 

Now before anyone looks at the data and says, "You lie!" there was on section where my heart rate was over 158 bpm for a while. In the back of the Domain, I drifted onto the slightly hilly dirt trail and decided to maintain speed rather than effort ... thus there was a bit of the route that wasn't technically easy. But hey, it was a super run (and easy overall).
