Warm. The city is getting quieter. Folk are heading if to the beaches and the baches.

Wasn't pushing it. A little distracted by my hip, but I think it is just deep bruising. It with be colourful when it comes out. 

Well, that's probably my last run until after Boxing Day. So here endeth my 10 run streak.

Have fun one and all, and run joyously.
