A rather grey day for our last one in NY/NJ. But nice for a run along the New Jersey side of the mighty Hudson river. There were some stairs involved (see picture to follow).  They put a crimp in my pace.  

There were a few other runners out. All of them wearing sweatsuits ... I guess it's a NJ thing (or a way to avoid the cold). 

Surprise surprise, my path crossed that of a pair of Canada geese and their goslings. 

All in all Weehawken (the township we're in) is pretty nice.
