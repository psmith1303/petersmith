Run 10 km and wonderful. 

Trying to ameliorate (in vain?) the impact of yesterday's most excellent roast turkey Christmas dinner and today's Boxing Day brunch. Not to mention all the other delectable strat were consumed. 

The 1000 Calories in this run will help, I suppose. 

I am convinced that generally I can run faster and more easily later in the day than early in the morning. I vaguely remember some research that said that. So why are so many marathons so early?  Traffic management I bet.
