In brief: 29 km plus a 5-mile race for a total of 28 km 

After Friday's hill, I had some DOMS in my quads; well it was a good descent. So my ran plan was to do 20 km at about 6:00 min/km and end at the start of the Headington 5-miler, then just 'go for it'. 

My race time was 40:03 and I'm pretty happy with that. 

Post race I had a banana and two bacon rolls--so yummy, so salty.
