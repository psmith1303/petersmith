A short tempo run. I know it was a tempo run because my average hear rate was about 162 bpm, and that's a few beats under my lactate threshold. 

I  pretty sure I couldn't hold a meaningful conversation as I was breathing pretty hard. 

Quite enjoyed Cornwall Park. Only half a dozen runners, and not many more cars. 

Right hip aches a little. Let's see if Monday's jab takes care of that.
