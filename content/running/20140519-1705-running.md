Hey ho. It's off we go. With the bright young things from the uni running club. 

Fun, fun, fun. Ran with a guy called Edward. He's a 3:30 sort of runner (Cripes). On the flat he took off like a rabbit and I tried to keep up with him. Aye corumba. Best I could do was 4:08. 

But you know what; it didn't feel like it was killing me. Maybe my MP should be 4:26 ....

Then again, it was only a short distance.
