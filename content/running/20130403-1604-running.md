Took this one really easy ...

... I hurt my back last week :(. Bruised disc says the physio. Couple of days on pain killers. A few easy mile runs :) Off pain killers. A good 10k run :) More easy mile runs :) A good 24k :). Pain pretty minimal :) A very pacey 5k ... Later that night :( oops. 

Three steps forward, two steps back :(
