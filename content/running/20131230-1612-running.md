Some light hills, intermingled with sunny spells (hot) and light showers. The normal crazy Auckland weather. 

Got a tweet from @anne_l whilst running. It reminded me of out trip with Brian up Mt Eden. I almost changed my plan and added that hill into this run .... but thought better of it. Don't want to over do things; so much is okay at the moment.
