Ran 26.5k in 2:15:00 flat, and felt tired. 

The last 10k was something of a chore. A real struggle to get under a 5:00 pace. 

Maybe it was the gardening over the weekend. Maybe it was the lack of a tempo run/pace work last week. Maybe it's because I ran with my Camelbak (+2Kg). Maybe it was the pacey splits in the middle (<4:45). Dunno. But it did turn into a grind. 

But now it's over and I feel great. 

Caught three rabbits. 

Achilles 1/10 (2/10 at 6km). Right adductor achey from about 23k. That threw my gait a bit--I definitely felt uneven on the last 3k. Must do more stretching.
