Well, I wasn't expecting that. Based on previous (recent) form, I was expecting something around 24 minutes, so I'm kind if chuffed with this. 

Spent the first three kilometres chasing Bryan. As I passed him I knew I needed to put some distance between us, otherwise he'd just run me down. I had to dig deep for that. Even so, he got close in the last 300m, so I had to push hard again. 

'Stewth, I've not worked that hard for a while. Hopefully, next week will be easier.
