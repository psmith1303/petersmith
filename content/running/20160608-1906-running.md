With the Newport 10-miler behind me, I'm now changing my routine. 

The plan is two days on, one day off. To spice things up, the second run will be a bit more up tempo, and at the weekend I'll do a longer run instead of the tempo run. Let's see how that goes. 

The thermostat has been turned down here in Montreal. The high was 14Â°C and with the wind it felt cooler than that. 

I kinda of want to start collecting some more badges from SmashRun ... I wonder what to go after.
