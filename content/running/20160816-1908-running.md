Out doing intervals with the HRR. good fun/work. I'm pretty poor at judging effort. I tend to go out too hard early on and have nothing left at the end. For example, in the final 30-second sprints, I could barely manage a jog.  

Part of it is how I 'pace' myself. For a 5k race--for instance--I go out hard and hang on for grim death; and the end of 5k there is nothing left. 

So when we do 5x4 minutes at 5k pace, for me that pretty emptied the tank. Even with a break there isn't much left for the next set of intervals. 

I'll talk to the coach about this at the next session.
