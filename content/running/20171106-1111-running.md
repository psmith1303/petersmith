So it’s November. My goal is 99km made up of lots of 5km runs with a longer weekly run. I say longer, but it only builds to 10km. 

I’ll mix the 5km runs up. Today was tempo work. The others are likely to be hills and sprint work. 

The ‘long’ runs will be at an easy pace. 

So today was meant to be tempo. Alas I didn’t not have the heart rate data to confirm it, but it felt like I was close to it. 

A good run on a good day.
