Legs felt pretty good all day. No DOMS. Yet, halfway through this run, I began to notice my quads. 

And now I have a theory. Of course. That's what I do :)

I think in trying to change my gait (hip position and kicking my feet up) instead of land over my centre of gravity, I'm actually land a little bit behind it. It's almost like I'm permanently running down hill. I.e, my leg is never fully extended. So I'm always loading my quads. 

Tomorrow at O'Hagan's I'll try and get some video of me running to see if I'm right. 

Lovely evening. K' Road was rather quiet and quite a few sex workers were out and about (17:30; that seems early, not that I'm an expert on such matters).
