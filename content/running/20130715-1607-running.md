Ran 11.24k in 56:52 minutes and felt invigorated. 

It was 11 degrees Celsius, when I set out. Ha! The weather forecasters were saying it wouldn't get into double digits to day. Anyway, decided that I didn't need gloves or a jacket. (Oh, that's right, I don't have a running jacket).

Anyway, by the 3k mark I wasn't cold, and by 5k I was toasty ... even my hands. 

It's good to be back. A few stiff and achey bits, but I'll just have to work through them. 

I didn't get in as much running whilst away as I had hoped. The agenda was just too packed, and when combined with jet-lag, it all became too hard. 

Anyway, @Andrew_e tells me it's 15 weeks until the Auckland marathon. Yikes!
