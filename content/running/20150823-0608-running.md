Run 34 of 83 (my count was a week out). Ten weeks until #aucklandmarathon. Whoohoo. 

This wasn't the run I planned. Crossed paths with Bodo Lang, and decided to run with him and his friends for s bit. Very good company. Good decision on my part. But ...

But it meant the direct route home included the hills of Shore Road. They aren't big, but they are big enough and very steep. Found myself doing the 'Brecon shuffle' to get up them. 

Being at the end on my long run, they pretty much wiped me out. 

Shoes. The new ASICS Gel Nimbus worked well. The changed my gait a little and I probably should have eased in to using them for a long run.  But hey, I'll adapt fairly quickly. 

As always with any new shoe, it'll take me a while to get the lacing just right.
