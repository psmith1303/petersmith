Messers Vim & Vigour were missing in action today. Maybe I should have waited longer after my breakfast---two eggs fried in coconut oil and a kind of oat-bran hash-brown. Yummy. 

Today's musical accompaniment was Queen's greatest hits (volume 1). 

There seemed to a few ' professional ladies' on K' Road. Maybe they are back from the holidays.
