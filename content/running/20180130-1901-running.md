That was a slog. 

I had Physio tomorrow day, dry needling around the bottom of my quads. The run to O’Hagan’s loosed/warmed up things.  The actual fun run got off to a dodgy start; I almost bailed at the 1km mark because my knee was unstable, but then it settled. 

After the O’Hagan’s the muscle felt like it was in spasm. 

So when I started running home, my leg felt mighty tight, almost un-runable. But I pushed through it, after nearly bailing. 

It’ll be interesting to see how it feels tomorrow.
