It's been a while since I ran in the rain. Nice. 

I was going up a small hill when @daniela's message "Go Peter" came through. That caused me to pick up my legs and push it at but. Thanks D. 

GPS track is off a bit so I deducted a kilometre from my distance. That happened because I was sheltering from the rain when setting things up. No proper GPS lock.
