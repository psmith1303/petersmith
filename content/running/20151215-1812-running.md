Not fun. The first 3 Km were OK. Not too fast, not to easy. But then my mojo left me, and u slugged out the last two kilometres. 

Hammy good. Quad 1/10. At least I think I know what's going on there and the osteo is helping me get my muscles in balance: hammy too strong--gluets almost non-existent, quads too strong--psoas pretty weak. The hard part is that I find it really hard to make either my gluets or my psoas fire :(

As I finishing my first ginger beer (free at the end of the run), I'm thinking "That wasn't too bad". Odd how quickly ones perspective can change.
