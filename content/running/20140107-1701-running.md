Out with the Uni runners. They were taking it easy so I went 'off road'. Well, I ran on the grass verge ... a YUPPY doing trail running :)

When we ran out of trail, I switched to running from the back of the rather extended pack to the front and then back again. That's rather hard work. 

All in all, a bit of a fartlek. 

Did I mention that today was a double-day. Two double-shot coffees, and two runs. That caffeine has a lot to answer for. 

I could really feel my gluets and hammys when going down St Stephens Road (a bit steep and at pace). Hope I haven't overdone anything.
