After last nights epic Chinese feast, and lunch out with Matt today, I was feeling pretty bloated and heavy on this run. 

Listened to the classic album “Endless 17”, by Heaven 17. Excellent. 

Rather slow going across the top of town. Lots of big junctions with lights. 

Knee was pretty good until College Hill. I guess that makes sense.
