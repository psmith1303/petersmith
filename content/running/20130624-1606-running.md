Ran 12.2k in 1:02:49 and felt good. 

I was kind of planning a long run today ... but my diary got crunched and I might be running tomorrow, so I opted for something a bit shorter (albeit with a wee hill). 

Talking of hills, as I'm flogging my way up (pace 6:20-ish), I get @mark_c in my ear saying "go go go go go". So, go I do, pulling the pace back to 5:18. Perfect timing Mark. 

Tried some music from @louise_s to power me along at the end. It was nice but didn't really drive me forwards. It'll be good on cruiser jaunts. When I look at my running playlist it's all pretty much at 180-190 bpm. I guess I'm a sucker for a good beat.
