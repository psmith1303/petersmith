Run 59 of 83. Clocking it. Spring is here and the clocks went forward this morning. What a great start to the day. 

Sunrise across the Waitakere Ranges in the west was spectacular. The out along the Eastern Bays and back. Stunning views across the harbour. 

Clocked this run at just about my goal marathon pace. And, I wasn't pushing it hard by any means. 

Result!

Finished on the flat, so had a 20 minute walk home, but picked up some bagels on the way :) I see bacon bagels in my future (for my second breakfast). 

Feeling fabulous.
