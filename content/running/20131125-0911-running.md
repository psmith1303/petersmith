I was going to go to the gym, but this seemed like more fun. Around about 8k I was regretting that ... My tank felt empty and my pace reflects that. 

My plan, my retrospective plan, was to run to constant effort. I went out moderate, but around 8k it suddenly felt moderate-hard. 

Generally good though. Hip 0/10. Achilles 1/10. Not bad, at all.
