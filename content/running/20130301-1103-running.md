Ran 11.2k in 59:27 and felt great. 

Better than my median pace on this route. That's getting harder to do. 

Got rather warm towards the end. Pheww. 

Rather uneventful, just ground it out whilst listening to a book. Actually, that is of note; normally books and podcasts hold my pace down. I normally need some good music to drive me along to beat my median pace/ time. 

Was past by a shirtless guy on a bike. You could see where his heart rate monitor had worn away the hair on his back.
