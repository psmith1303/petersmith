I was lucky enough to pace a woman around the first 3 km before I felt the urge to open up a gap. In the last 800 m I passed a guy, but he wasn't going to be a pushover so I had to dig deep for the last 200 m. Result. 

On the wet Tarmac, these Brookes Pure Cadence are a little slippery. I land fairly flat-footedly and I can feel them sliding just a smidgen. It doesn't feel great ... so I'll avoid running in them when it's wet. 

Got some nice encouragement from Daniela late in the run and that helped me along. Thanks D. 

There can't be many of these left before we stop for the Winter (darkness methinks, rather than cold).
