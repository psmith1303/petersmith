Ran 15k in 1:17:18 and felt really quite good. 

This was to be a gentle run with @andrew_e, but his cold moved on to his chest, so sensibly he gave it a miss. 

The first 5k were rather easy (5:22 pace). Maybe that's because I was listening to the (BBC) Radio 4 Friday Night Comedy podcast. I then switched to my 180bpm playlist to try and get back to MP (5:00 pace). 

Managed to claw it back to 5:08 (whole run average pace). It's so hard to make up lost time. I was really pleased with how much of the last 10k I did at sub 5:00. 

Missed the rain, which was good. Missed Andrew, which was bad. 

Saw no rabbits.
