Didn't stop to smell the coffee. But I did stop to pick up my meds:

Masters runner + vitamin D = Happy runner

Well, that's true for winter anyway. 

Although I did stop, I forgot to pause the clock. BUT this is still my fastest run on this route. The hills were much less of a challenge. I guess those random hills on the treadmill are paying off. 

So this run definitely gets a smiley face.
