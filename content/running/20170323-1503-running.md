Ran 11 km in 58 minutes and felt good 

If I believe my heart rate monitor I was either having a heart attack towards the end of this run, or it was making good contact. Since I'm still walking around ok, I'll blame it on poor contact. 

Sunny and warm. So I'm a bit sticky as I walk into the office. Nice.
