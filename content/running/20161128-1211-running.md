It was a crisp clear sunny morning first thing today. Some blustery winds brought in some clouds. Those winds made my run out along the causeway hard work. Of course, the wind acted as an assist in the return leg. 

I was thinking of doing 15 km today, but it's been a while so nice I've done that distance. By 14 km I was feeling it in my abductors so I called it there. 

Tried to keep my pace even and I feel good about the run.
