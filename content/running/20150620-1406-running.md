Lisa B is in town, so went dancing together. She's a great dance partner, and the K's flew by. 

Wet. I've bought a New Balance shower jacket, and this was the first time (ever) I've run in a jacket. Interesting. I'm not sure if I like it or not. Once I got a bit warm and sweaty ... well you probably know. 

All in all, an easy run for about an hour. No aches or pains. Let's see what tomorrow brings.
