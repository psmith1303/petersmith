Run 53 of 83. Meant to listen to a collection of early 70s hits ... But accidentally ended up with a playlist of silly songs (e.g. My old man's a dustman). This helped to keep me at an easy pace. 

A little damp out. Humid too. So I felt hot and sweaty. 

Lots of runners out. A few packs. Now that we're six weeks out from the Auckland marathon, that's probably not surprising.
