The plan ... To be back to see the end of the America's Cup race. 

So, the mission was kinda met. Certainly, got back in time.  

The run ... Me and hills aren't best of friends at the moment. The certainly load up my right hip abductor, and then to my outer hip bursa. So, back to only flat running for now. And I'll work on strengthening my gluets etc.  


Not sure if I'll do the Onehunga half-marathon next week (but it is flat).
