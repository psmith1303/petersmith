Run 68 of 83. What luck! I thought this mid-week long run was meant to be 21 Km, but when I checked my training schedule I found it was only 16 Km. Woohoo

Saying there was some wind is an understatement. On the return leg as I turned into Misson Bay (and again at Okahu Bay) I found myself being blown sideways. And when the wind was head on it was hard work. At times I felt like I was making no headway. 

Thank heavens for my Asics hat. I don't think anything else would have stayed on my head. 

Happy with my pace ... but is was more work than planned.
