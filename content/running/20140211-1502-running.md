No O'Hagan's 5Km run for me tonight. Physio says I've a teeny tear in my right hammy. So, light duties for a while. Hence this short, slow, and easy run. 

A hex on those lunges. Physio says he never recommends them ...

There is a long back story on that hammy. I originally tore it in a race a few years ago, and I (we) don't think that we dealt to the scarring well. It's been a bit odd since then.

... oh well, it's a chance to spend some time and attention on strengthening and lengthening my hammies.
