And he is back ...

A long slow distance run with @andrew, out to St Heliers and back what a glorious day for it. The views across the harbour and out to the Coromandel where stunning. 

The site of the steroid jab was good, but I'm experiencing a bit of bursitist.  I see stretching in my future. 

In my planning for this month's running, I missed the fact that tomorrow is also March!!! As I'm doing O'Hagan's tomorrow, that'll put me well over my target. Hmmm. I'll have to claw that back somehow over the next few months. 

Anyway, all in all, it's good.
