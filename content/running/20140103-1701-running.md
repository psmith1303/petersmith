A bit later run, a bit more cloud cover. Much cooler ... at this point someone should jump in and say, "But, Peter, you're always cool". 

Solid run. Fewer/smaller hills feels good. I'll stick to them for a while longer. 

K' Road and it's environs are returning to normal. So, a bit more weaving around. But still okay.
