Happy, happy, happy happy. 

Oddly only four of us turned up for the Shoe Science run, so we cruised round together. The actual 'run' was about 5.2k in 28mins; a  5:28 pace. 

Achilles were a little tired after the hills of Waiheke, but all good really. 

Starting to look forward to the Round the Bays run on Sunday (and my 32k long run on Monday).
