Run 15 of 80. Not too bad at all. I felt I was pushing myself on this run, but the traffic lights ate away any advances I made. I'm looking forward to reviewing this run on #SmashRun do I can see what went on in glorious Technicolor.  

A fine day for it. I bumped in to a couple of runners from the old Shoe Science running group. I couldn't keep up with them ... they were on bikes :)

I almost brained myself on a overhanging branch.  A bit of sun strike blinded me and I only just managed to duck. That would have hurt. 

Now it is time to freshen up and head to Uni.
