Well that felt easier than last week, and I was 20 seconds faster overall. So let's call that a win. 

I was much more even in my pace. Not much more than 3 or 4 seconds difference on each split. 

Chased Brian most of the time, but he was always just ahead of me. But by a smaller distance than last week. 

Overall, not too bad after my hill run on Sunday and my long run yesterday. 

Having said that, Jason was here having done the Tarawera 100 Km ultra marathon on Saturday.  He looked in good form.
