It is so hard to run at goal marathon pace whilst keeping my cadence under 190. Mind you, at the moment gMP seems hard full stop 

I guess that's what training is all about. 

Lots of activity down at the Viaduct ... there must be loads of events on for the Anniversary Weekend. 

Right, and now to breakfast.
