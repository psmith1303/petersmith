I had to push it a bit to get here on time, and that took its toll a bit. 

Taylor took off like a rocket. So, I chased her down over the first couple of kilometres. Then it was a matter of keeping ahead. She tried to pass me a couple of times--but I kept a lead. Mind you it was a sprint in the last 2 km, and I was 2 seconds ahead at the line. 

8 seconds faster than last week :)
