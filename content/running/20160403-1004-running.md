The annual Jock Strap and G-string run. Now which was I meant to be wearing?  Ha ha. The name is symbolic rather than a statement of fact. 

That was a bit of work. I could feel my hammy. Not a pain nor an ache. I could just feel it. I guess that's lack of use and healing. 

All things considered---grass running, lack of practice, etc---I'm happy with my sub-5 min/km pace. If I can do that at the Newport 10-miler I'll be a happy chappy.
