The first half of this run was wet. Torrential downpours. Well and truly soaked. The second half was sunny and pretty warm. Ah, the joys of Auckland. 

After the weekends race, I was kind of keeping this easy. Quads are feeling it. Hammy was a bit twitchy at times. But all good really. 

I think I'm on track for a solid marathon (less than four weeks now). Not record breaking,  but it'll be good. 

I just need to stay injury free.
