Another state, another run. 

As we were close to Central Park, I had to run there. I followed part of the iconic route taken by Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man. 

Being a bit fuzzy this morning, I only packed one running sock :( do I had to run in regular (cotton socks). Fortunately no damage was done. 

Few places to change here and nowhere to leave a bag. Thus I ran with my pack ... that made it harder work. 

This is something of a runner's paradise. There are tracks for runners (one way only around the big lake) the roads have separate two-lane 'tracks' one for runners one for cyclists in both directions. Consequently I saw many runners.
