After last night's torrential I thought this run might be a wet one, but no such luck. A small patch of blue is over the CBD and that meant a dry run. 

Nevertheless, the conditions for running were good. 

Breezed round this short loop. 

Got served by a 12 year old who rocketed past me in the Domain. I'm still half asleep so I was in the zone to race :)
