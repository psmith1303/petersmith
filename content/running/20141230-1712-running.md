Unlike many of my chums here on Dailymile who are winding up to some big distance races (e.g. Tarawera ultra---props to you folk), I'm winding down for the year. 

:)

One more run and I'll hit my goal for 2014, then it's on to my 2015 plan. That mainly revolves around a few races with @andrew (Round the Bay's, Run Auckland series, the Huntly half, and the Auckland marathon). Did I miss anything Mr E?

Another warm run. The promised rain didn't materialise. Pretty quiet out. 

Mayhaps, I'll get out early tomorrow before it warms up.
