A wee bit slower than last year (12:37 vs 13:29). It was rough after yesterday's workout with Kat. So many bits were achy/fatigued before the start of the run. 

But it was fun. 

The rain had stopped so it was a dry run. Now time to go home, and see my darling Princess ahead of here birthday dinner.
