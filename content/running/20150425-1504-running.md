&#39;strewth, that was hard work. This cross-country malarkey, running on grass, is hard work; and there are the fences to jump too!I was 7 seconds faster than my handicap time. Pretty close. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what the team did overall. But I do know I was faster than the number 2 man (Bryan) who had the same handicap as me (but was actually 7 seconds slower). So, jointly, we were bang on time.
