Out with Bill and Mac (who is just back from Japan). They are faster runners than me. St the end they were a good 300m ahead, and they pulled that far ahead in the last kilometre

Hot! 

When I stopped I was still out of breath for 30+ metres. Phew. 

Sweaty. 

Glorious out. Great views across the Waitamata harbour.
