More YUPPY trail running (me, on the grass of the playing fields). 

A super-duper evening run. 

Every time I run here, I remember the time that @kim and I did a few laps here. That was a while ago now. 

Did a dozen or so lunges on the grass Afterwards. That was a bit of a shock to my right hammy :)

Now for a quick shower and off to meet my Princess.
