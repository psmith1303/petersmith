Breezy. My glasses were nearly blown off at one stage. 

I seemed to have spent most of this run by myself. A pack well ahead of me and a long tail of runners well behind me. Not much chasing :(

Still, I was ahead of median and under 20 minutes (just). Achilles 2/10 ... Grrr. I see ice in my future. And some more easier running. No intervals this week.
