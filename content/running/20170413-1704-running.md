Ran 11.3 km in 62 minutes and felt good. 

When I planned this run I was expecting to do it in the middle of tropical cyclone Cook. But the cyclone tracked a little further east than originally predicted. So, the was a dry run ... except for me being a bit sweaty. 

@Graham called whilst I was running so we had a bit of a chat for a couple of Kilometres. We'll catch up properly next week before he runs in the World Masters. Sounds like he is in good condition.
