Daylight saving was introduced in the UK in 1916 as a means of saving coal during WW 1. One hundred years later, as daylight saving ends here in NZ, this run is much darker than it would have been last week. 

It'll be darker next week :(

Pushed it just a little, but not too much. Pretty happy with my time.
