My first 'long' run in the wind up to the Kirikiriroa marathon. Was scheduled to do 11 km, but I thought I'd scale it back to 7 km, picked a route in error that ended up being 9 km :)

All pretty good. 

Very warm and humid. It must be close to 100%. Feels like it might rain ... but not just yet. 

Note to self: felt my hamstring at the start of the run (again).
