I absolutely LOVE running in Auckland. It doesn't matter if its hot or cold, dry or wet, one can put on a t-shirt, shorts, and shoes and be off and running. No need for thermals or ice shoes ... the same gear is good all year round. 

A bit of a 'cold' snap blew in.  Cold rain (instead of warm tropical rain). A 'cold' breeze. 

So, on with the t-shirt, shorts, and shoes (and a good dose of body-glide); then off for a late arvo run. Magic. I found myself splashing through every large puddle on the way back. So much fun. 

Methinks I'm having a little ITB trouble on the right side. More rolling and stretching seems to be in my future. As the song goes, "we can work it out". 

Took it moderately. Really? Yes, really. Now, if only I can do this pace for another 31km. Ho, ho, ho. 

I'm sure it'
