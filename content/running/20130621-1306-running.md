Ran 13k in 1:08:00 and felt excellent. 

This run was so cruisy. I can hardly believe how easy it felt. I was planning an easy-ish run as this week is a bit of a step-up in distance, so I didn't have a pace target. 

When I set off there was some icy rain and a nasty wind. But by the time I hit the waterfront, the rain had gone, the wind had gone, and the sun was shinning. Glorious running conditions.
