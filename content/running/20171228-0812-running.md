Wow! I haven’t run this route since April 2017; that’s 8 months. I can’t remember what was going on then, but clearly I’ve been “in recovery” from various things. 

An overcast day, but still a little warm. 

Whilst not taking it easy, I didn’t push it. I was keen to see how my back took it (okay) and my knee (okay-ish). No worries. 

My right shoe was over-tight and I felt it at the end of the run. 

The blasted water fountain was broken! I had reported it because it was leaking, and now it doesn’t work at all. Doh! So I’ve now reported that too.
