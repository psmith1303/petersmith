An easy run to close out my milage target for the month. 150 km done, next month 170 km. Towering stairs, here I come (see, smashrun). 

Busy along the waterfront. Two cruise ships (including the QE2); the round the world race; the cricket World Cup; and all the normal folk too. 


And now, to meet my brother for coffee.
