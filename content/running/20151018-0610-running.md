Run 74 of 83. Going really well until the point where I stopped this run as I got a mighty cramp in my right hammy. Luckily I have a Physio appointment tomorrow so I can get it checked. 

Grrr. Double grrr. This was only meant to be 26 km, but I judged the turnaround wrong. 

Crossed paths with Anna from Tempo Run at about 19 Km. she was cooling down at about a 4:30 pace, so I tagged along for a couple of Kilometres (until we went our separate ways). Good company; made the running easy. 

Lot of runners out, but it quietened down after about 8:00. Perhaps folk were staying home to watch the rugby World Cup (NZ vs ???)
