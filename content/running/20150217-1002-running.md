Having caffeine-loaded ahead of this run (three flat whites), I was enurred against the temptations offered by the many cafes that litter this route. 

Note, caffeine-loading is nothing like carb-loading, except it is fun. 

That all felt okay. The hill does make a dent in my pace ... And it's quite a long hill over a short route.
