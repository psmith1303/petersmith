A super day for a run. Azure sky, but not hot (yet). Town is quite. The gods of the traffic lights are munificent. Lovely. 

A surprising number of 'professions ladies' are around K' Road. I use the term ladies in its gender non-specific sense. 

An easy run. I seem to be slowing down. Good job I've started to do the O'Hagan 5km run each week. That will arrest the slide a little. In this phase of training, Jack Daniels suggests adding in some strides at the end of some of the easy runs. I might add that in to the mix soon. 

And now it's time for breakky; a couple of fried eggs. Yum.
