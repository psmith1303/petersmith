The plan: very steady pace (once I'm through the starting crowds). 

The actuality ... Went out a little too fast 4:38, and only settled in to my target pace after 4km. 

Saw @louise_s at the start. She said she planned to do 4:45 pace. I suspect she blitz it. @jason_b was around and even faster (as always). 

As for me. Okay until about 18k and then some grief (2/10) from my groin. So, I had a massage afterwards. 

All in all, not bad. But I don't know where this leaves me for the Auckland marathon in five weeks.
