Lovely day for a run. Clear and sunny. Gotta a tweet from @chrism42k, who had just finished a 20 mile trail run in the snow ...  Ah, I could handle a little snow about now. 

My longest run in a while and it showed. I slowed on every little hill and towards the end I was definitely weary (as opposed to fatigued). My pace graph says it all. 

But, I did do this ahead of my median time on this route, so it's scores a smiley face.
