A rather busy Sunday, and I had to fit a run in where I could. So I ended up running around Remuera; and I wasn't in the mood for laps. That meant a few more hills. Not many other options from here. But, listening to @kim_w, I took them easier than yesterday. 

Super day for a run. So I did a super run for the day. 

I do like these Brooks Pure Cadence ...  They feel pretty nice.
