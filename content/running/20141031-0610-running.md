It's been awhile since I did the "get out if bed and immediately go for a run" thing. (Well I did change into my running gear, but I was out the door pretty fast)

Of course it was pretty quiet around, although a few offices were opening up. Saw maybe 10 other runners which was a surprise. I rarely see more than 2 on this route. Mind you the are never going in my direction:)
