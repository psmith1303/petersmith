Ran 11:13 in 53 mins and felt like u had worked hard ...

... and I had. I was within 30s of a PB on this route. So it was a good run. 

It was lunchtime on Tamaki Drive, and there were a lot of folk out doing the Powerade Challenge (not me). Caught three rabbits, and five got away because our routes diverged. 

Mild and overcast. Bopped along to the Black-eyed Peas. What do you thing @louise_s :)
