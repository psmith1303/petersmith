Spring has definitely sprung and I'm making sure I run in the morning (15Â°C) rather than in the afternoon (23Â°C). 

Added another kilometre today's run. Some tiredness in the hammy after the run ... but tomorrow is a day off of tuning and on Sunday I'll do an easy 5Km. 

The trees are freshly green and the sky is brilliant blue. It makes running a joy.  That said, it would be nice to find some running partners here.
