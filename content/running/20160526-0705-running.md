My legs felt heavy today, do I'm not surprised that my average pace was just over 6 min/km. 

This wax a pretty and as I took a few new paths I occasionally stopped to consult the map. 

I find the schools here such a contrast in their physicality compared to those in NZ. Here them are often multi-storey monoliths ... looking massive factory or office blocks of the 1900s. Of course the are more recent than that. I'll get some pics later.
