A but it f an experiment. See how steady I can be by feel on this 11 km run. 

Okay, I looked at my data for the first 300m or so to make sure I didn’t go out too hard. Then it was all by feel. 

And I felt hot!

Despite taking on some water I definitely faded in the later stages. It’ll be interesting to see what @smashrunhq make of it.
