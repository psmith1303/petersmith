A lovely Spring dat for my first run in Montreal.  Taking it easy ... I'm not running the Mount yet (but I will). 

With only four weeks until the Newport 10-miler I need to (sensibly) improve my condition. Stating from a low base my plan is to run every other day. With ever other run, I'll bump the mileage by a kilometre or two. E.g., 5,0,6,0,5,0,7,0,5,8, ... and so on. What do you think Coach Kim?
