Wow. It was so hard to keep my pace down to 6:15 or slower. Went out too fast (5:30-ish) and the winding back meant I had to hit 7:09 or slower. 

Was listening to a book to distract me, but the result was I kept drift up and getting faster. 

In the end, I had to constantly monitor my pace (and average pace) to hit my target for this run. 

Missed the rain, but I'll probably get drenched going home.
