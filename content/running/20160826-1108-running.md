A hill!  I was going to do a run around Gainsborough, then I thought "Nah, I need a hill."

I think this is the highest point in the Peak District.

Some of it was steep; hands and knees stuff. Some of it was wet. It was all good. Lots of sun. A bit of wind. Boy, did my legs feel wobbly after the descent. 

Job done.
