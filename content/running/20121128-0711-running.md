A run of many parts. But first it was super encouraging to hear @chris_c, @peter_g, and @brian as I was running along (thanks to the vocal styling of Lucy, my chosen voice of Runmeter. I'm going to be so surprised when I meet Peter and Brian and find out they don't have a British female accent).

Now back to the run. I had to drop some stuff off to the library, thus this wasn't a regular route. There were hills. Well, hills for me; I suspect @nic_a would call them mere bumps in the road. Yesterday's gym work definitely had an impact (braking effect) on me -- especially doing Jacobs Ladder which is a real hoot. 

If you look at the map, you'll see me doing a loop. That's me 'trail running' on a bit of grass. I hope @louise_s and @tago are laughing at that. 

Then it was back along the motor
