It's a little wet ... but I'm going for it anyway. 

Wow. That was hard. The rain was a non-event; but the headwind....

At times I was pushing darn hard and couldn't get faster than 5:20 or so. It was as hard as running up Mt Eden. I just couldn't pick up the pace. My back even aches from leaning into the wind. 

So I guess that it was a good workout. 

My hip was really good until about 10k ... that's progress. The stretching and the hip strengthening could be working. I suspect that if this hadn't been a hard run, my hip wouldn't have been a problem. Achilles 1/10. It's all heading in the right direction.
