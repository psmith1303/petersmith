Run 44 of 83. It's only eight weeks until the Auckland marathon. I'm now half way through my training programme. Feeling on-track. 

A nice and easy run with Tony Coombe (another ASICS Roadtester). Good company. Thanks Tony. 

We set off in sunshine, but about half way into the run we got well and truly drenched. As well bounded up the last hill (and the last kilometre), the sun came out again. That's so Auckland.
