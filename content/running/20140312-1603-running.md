Stunningly nice afternoon. Life is good. 

After a few extra-effort runs (Sunday, Tuesday, and maybe Monday), the plan was for an easy run around the Domain. Looking at my heart rate and my pace that mission was accomplished. 

It's odd, but I think I have become conditioned to run slower on grass. Or maybe it really is harder than road running. Either way I don't seem to get close to a 5:39 pace.
