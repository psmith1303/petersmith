Okay, my goal was to do the first 5k easy and the second 5k hard (either flat-ish and fast, or hit the hills ... dependent on which route we get). 

Mission accomplished.

We ended up doing a rolling route so I went for tempo, which turned out to be a 4:41 pace over the 5k. Two whippets from the group passed me and I caught one rabbit. 

At the end of the Shoe Science run there was a draw for a new pair of Saucony shoes. Result! I'll pick them out later in the week. I'll also treat myself to a new Polar Bluetooth heart rate monitor.
