Ran 10k in. 44:47 and felt hot. 

Started out at about 4:32 pace, and at 4k began to speed up. Kept inching it up until the last Km at 4:22. 

Hip okay  'til about 8km. Changed my gait and it stayed okay upto the 9km mark. That's when I decided to call it a day. 

Then I thought, I've got my breath back let's try quick mile. But I bottled at half a mile in 3:11

Drank 750ml of icky Powerade.
