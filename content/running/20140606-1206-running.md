I'm trying to stay on top of my weekly mileage goal so a slightly longer run than usual at moderate effort. 

I've done more long runs (well 10 Km-ish) this week than I have in the rest if 2014. I must watch that I don't shift my training load around too much. 

A very tanned a fit looking whippet in a colourful skort tried to overtake me of the home straight ... But I wasn't going to let that happen. 

I was pretty surprised to get the stitch at about 6 Km.  I don't recall the last time that happened. 

Pretty pleased with the run. Pace was good and I'd say my RPE was about 7.   But I do wonder if I'm a little too conditioned to running shorter distances.
