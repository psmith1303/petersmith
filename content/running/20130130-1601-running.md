After yesterday's long run I tackled today's Shoe Science run with some trepidation. The first 5k (my warm up) I took pretty easy. I tried a new route up Valley Road--what a great street for hill training. Not too steep and a good distance. Love it. 

At Shoe Science, it was a 5K-ish time trial. Yowser!  Hard work. Look at my heart rate; it peaked at 185 and averaged 173. It's not a flat route by any means ... But there are now big hills. Average pace was 4:47, which I'm pleased about. My fastest was 3:47. All good, but tiring in the sun. 

Followed it by a gentle trot (jog) home. 

Done.
