A tiny tapper ahead of Sunday's 10-miler.  I wast sure d be ready in time, but I think I am. It won't be my fastest outing, but it is bound to be fun (despite the predicted rain). 

Lovely early run here today. Trying to keep it steady; my hammy feels okay and I want to keep it that way. The biggest challenges was all the kids walking to school (all ages). You wouldn't see that much in Auckland.
