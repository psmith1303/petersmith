It was a bit wet. Not when I started ... but it sure was by the end. Early in the run, I saw many people with umbrellas and wondered "Do they know sometime I don't?"  Clearly they did. 

Ran along the lake and the gorge. Crossed two rivers by mistake--I thought I was on one bank when I was actually across town :)

The plan said 5 and the a longer run on Wednesday, and I drifted into doing the longer run today. That'll give me more of a wind down to Sunday's race.
