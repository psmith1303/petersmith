It's Canada Day, and judging by the amount if rubbishy and furniture out in the streets it must be 'moving day' soon (when all the apartment rentals expire). 

Running in Monteal is pretty fine. The road-rules are such that at most junctions pedestrians have right of way (except at the big light-controlled junctions--but even those are pretty permissive). Mind you it must be hard work in the winter. I've run here in the snow in March and that was tricky. It must be really difficult in January and February (the the very low temperatures and the snow). 

But today's run was bright and sunny. Most enjoyable. I no longer feel like a slug when I'm running ... although I don't have much speed yet. That'll come. 

Now to go and do some writing.
