Ran 16k in 1:28:04 and felt okay. 

This was meant to be a 21k run, but around 8k my right hammy was complaining. Since this is a step back week, I decided not to push through it. 

In hindsight it was a good call as it didn't get any better. Yes, I'll be taking this week easy ... the last month has seen some hard work from me. 

Mind you, even today's pace would see me doing a sub four hour marathon; something I used to dream of.
