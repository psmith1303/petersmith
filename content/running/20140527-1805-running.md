Kind of took it easy ... although I kind of lost it in the last 1500m. But no harm done.  Hunted down a few rabbits at the end (@kim is right again). 

We almost killed @andrew, but he says the PB was worth it. The challenge is that he is feeding that pace into his training plan for Auckland. He'll be flying there!!!

Lovely cool evening for a run. Didn't try for a PB myself (too many aches), yet it was a great end to the series. I'm looking forward to the new series in August.
