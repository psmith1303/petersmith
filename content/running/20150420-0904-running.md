Monday, Monday. This is a step back week, so I kicked it if with a 15 km long run (versus 21 km last week). 

I should have worn my sunnies; it was pretty bright by the time I finished. A nice outing ... no sign of rain after last night. 

A few minor twinges in my right hip, but it's feeling okay really. 

Bananarama loomed large in today's playlist (for some reason). A nice flashback :)

A few major junctions in this run. They ate into my time a bit. But better safe than sorry.
