Another great day for a run in the City of Sails; and that wind would make for some excitement on the water. 

About halfway round this route there is a bit of an uphill. Rather than using my normal approach---constant effort---I decided to power through it. A good bit anaerobic work. Well over my lactate threshold :)

It's only been a week, but this day on/day off routine seems okay.
