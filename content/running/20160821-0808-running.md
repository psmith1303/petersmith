Out for a long run with a group from the HRR. 

Saw many new parts of Oxford. That is one of the bonuses of being with a group like this--aside from the good company/conversation. It's also nice just following; not thinking about navigating a new place. 

The hardest part was dodging the stinging nettles. I almost think
The local runners are immune :)

A couple of hills. One of the was long enough to practice a high cadence descent. My gluets are thanking me for that.
