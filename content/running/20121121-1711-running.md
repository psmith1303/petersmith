Another three part run. A 5km warm up. Then the Shoe Science 5km. Then 1km home :)

Ow. Ouch. Ow. After yesterday's hard workout, I've horrible DOMS in my upper arms and everything connected to them. Every step ached. Even those muscles on my sides (obliques?) hurt. Thank heavens there isn't much that can make DOMS worse. 

So a very gentle first 5k, and a bit speedier on the second 5k. 

Hot. Sweaty. Ymmm.
