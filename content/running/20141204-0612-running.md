First run since my fall and my hernia op. 

I think I felt a little tightness in my right groin ... But that quickly passed. 

Ribs, especially the right side, grumbled all the way (2/10). 

It was a surprise that my right ankle was twingey (1/10). I thought I was over that. 

Overall, I think it's a little early yet to go back to running.
