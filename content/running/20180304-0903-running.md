Not my fastest Round the Bays, but then again I donâ€™t normally have to run to the start because the race transportation (bus) breaks    down. 

Got to the start with 10 minutes to, having blagged my way along to start of the course. 

Went out at about 4:30 mins/km which seemed okay for the first couple of Kilometres. But the little hill at the turnover put a small dent in that. 

Still okay after 3 km, but by 5.5 km I had slowed to 4:50 mins/km and I had to start to dig deep. 

Anyway finished in under 40 minutes, so thatâ€™s a win.
