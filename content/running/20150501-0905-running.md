After yesterday's workout with Kat,  was feeling a bit beaten up so Andrew and I opted for a gentle run along the waterfront. 

Once I started running ... ouch ... DOMS in my hamstrings. No wonder I was feeling beaten. All those squats yesterday. 

Anyway, it was a lovely run. The weather was stunningly good. The conversation was deeply engaging. Good stuff. 

By the last 400m my legs feeling okay so we put our foot down (sub 4:00 min/km) and the extra stretch in my hamstrings was noticeable.
