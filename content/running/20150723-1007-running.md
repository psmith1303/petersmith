Run 12 of 80. Same route as yesterday, and whilst I was 1 second per Km slower I felt the run was more even. 

Now that the semester has started I'm teaching from 8-10 (a good group of first-year students), so I'm doing this run on only two cups of coffee; that's my total fuel for today (so far). 

A few minor niggles in my hip, but it continues to improve. Fundamentally everything is heading in the right direction. I just need to make sure I don't overcook things.
