The DOMS in my quads from last Monday's long run is still here. I'm wondering if I should skip this coming Mondays 19 Km run. I would like my quads to settle. Nowadays it seems to take longer to get over these things. 

As I trogged around the block I listened to hits of 1977. Such classics as 2-4-6-8 motorway, and the like. 

It's a warm Easter Saturday, and there wasn't much of a breeze. Do I feel toasty.
