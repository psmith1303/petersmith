Run 16 of 80. It's been wet and windy today, and I was all set for a soaking (except I didn't have any Body Glide). But, by chance, I got a break in the weather. 

Kind of pleased with this run. I had to do 9 or 12, and as it was going well, I opted for 12. I can now do an easy 9 tomorrow (which will be hood as the day is packed). 

Feeling good.
