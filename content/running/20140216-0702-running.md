New shoes (Karhu) ... Very hard to go slow. Missed my goal pace (> 6:00).  

These shoes feel firm; there isn't much cushioning. I don't notice the fulcrum effect that they tout; but that's okay. 

Overall, the shoes feel good and I'm interested to see how they perform 'at pace', but that will need to wait for another week.
