Well the month in running is almost over and I'm keen to hit my target, but not exceed it. So, I was going to only do 3 km but I was filled with the spirit of the running gods so I did a slightly longer route. 

Quite a mix of music. Particularly enjoyed the Perfecto Allstars with 'Reach up', and 'This little light' by Kelly G. 

Now for some homemade soda bread.
