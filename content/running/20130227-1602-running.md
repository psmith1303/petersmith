Ran 11k in about 55 minutes and felt great. 

I say about 55 minutes because I forgot to start Runmeter on my last lap. 

So, talk about coincidence. Only yesterday was I rambling on about 5k pace/times, and today's Shoe Science run was a 5k time trial. 

Actually, I have it down as 4.64k which I did in 21:29. That's 12s slower than last time on this route :( Maybe yesterday's sprint had an impact (just kidding). 

Oh, well. Maybe I'll do a spin class tomorrow.
