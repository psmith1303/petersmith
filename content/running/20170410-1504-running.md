Ran 16 km in 83 minutes and good. A gentle headwind in the way out kept me cool, but on the way back I was hot and sweaty. I felt like I was running very event (except for lights, water stops, changing music, etc) so in the last couple of kilometres I upped my effort. Felt very solid throughout the run. Had a gel at about 7 km.
