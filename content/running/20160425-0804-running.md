Down, past the casino to the riverfront. What is it with runners and routes along the water ... I certainly wasn't the only one on the banks of the mighty Mississippi.  

A somewhat stop start run as I crossed the roads. Being new here, and with traffic coming from the 'wrong' side, I was cautious crossing junctions. 

A little warm ... but this is Louisiana.
