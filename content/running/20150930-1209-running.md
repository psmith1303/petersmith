Run 61 of 83. Has it really been 20 months since I ran sprints. 'Strewth, yes. I feel like a naughty naughty runner. I have drive but not so much discipline. 

I managed 7 reps before I felt my form turning to custard. Next time I expect I'll be able to do a bit more. 

Spring sunshine. Lots of folk around the Domain. Nice.
