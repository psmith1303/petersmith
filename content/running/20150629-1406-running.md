The weather has been quite mixed today: rain, sun, wind, etc. so I went in this run expecting the same. But it brighten up nicely. 

A pleasant trot into and across town. Ran in some beaches, which was nice. Ran across some mud flats, which was messy. That made my shoes rather heavy. Mud galoshes, so to speak. They take some cleaning. 

On the way back, I paused briefly at Raglan Roast for a macchiato. Very fine. 

I've roughed out a training plan to get me to the Auckland marathon at the start of November. It feels like I don't have enough time ... but it'll be alright. 

Now for a shower and to try and clean my shoes.
