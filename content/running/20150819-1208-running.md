Run 31 of 80. A bit wet still. Still got a bit of a head cold. 

Ran naked = no tech telling me how things are going. No music, books, or podcasts. Just me and my head. Having a cold, I thought running by feel would be a good thing. 

Oddly, this was my fastest time (well pace) on this route. I can't really say time as I pushed it out to 10 km instead of 9 km (10 was on the plan). 

Who would have thunk it.
